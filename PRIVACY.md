# Privacy

_Last updated: 2 October 2026_

Amazing Codex GUI is a panel for OpenAI's Codex CLI inside JetBrains IDEs. With four exceptions, all
described below, it sends nothing anywhere: the agent runs on your machine, the conversation stays on
your machine, and the plugin has no account of any kind. It collects no analytics unless you allow the
anonymous usage statistics described in the fourth exception.

The first exception is **remote access**, which lets you answer your agent from your phone. It is off
when the plugin is installed and stays off until you turn it on. Most of this page is about what
happens when you do.

The second is **feedback** - the form behind the speech bubble beside the heart. Nothing travels from
it unless you write something and press Send; see "Feedback" at the end of this page.

The third is **voice input** - dictation with a Deepgram key of your own. It is off until you turn it
on and add a key, and it records only while you hold the hotkey or the microphone button is lit; see
"Voice input" below.

The fourth is **anonymous usage statistics**: daily counts of how the panel is used, which help the
author decide what to work on. The panel asks once, and nothing is sent unless you press Allow; see
"Usage statistics" below.

## What travels, and where

When remote access is on, your conversations travel to the devices you have paired - your phone -
through a **relay**: a small server whose only job is to pass messages between two machines that
cannot reach each other directly.

What travels is the conversation itself. That means everything the agent reads and writes: **your
source code**, file paths, the output of commands it runs, your messages and its answers.

The relay is at `wss://relay-codex.mzpizote.com`, run by the plugin's author on a server rented from OVH
and located in the United States (Virginia). Its source is public, and you can point the plugin at a
relay of your own instead - see "Running your own relay" below.

## What the relay can and cannot see

**It cannot read any of your content.** Everything inside an envelope is encrypted between your IDE
and your phone, and the relay holds no key to it. This is a property of how it is built rather than a
promise about how it behaves: the routing code reads two fixed offsets of a 42-byte header, and there
is no code on that server that parses a body, nor any dependency that could.

**What it does see:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Two random 16-byte addresses | One for your IDE, one for your phone. They are random and derived from nothing about you - but they are stable, so the relay could link your sessions over time |
| The size of each message | Not the content, but roughly how much is moving |
| The time of each message | Which means, in practice, **your working hours** - when your IDE is connected and how busy it is |
| Your IP address | Both your machine's and your phone's, as any server sees |
| How many devices you have paired | And which of them talk to which IDE |

It does **not** see: the contents of any message, your file names or their contents, the commands your
agent runs, the names of your projects, your Codex account, or your email address.

**It stores nothing on disk.** No database, no volume. Its whole state is a map of open connections
and a short buffer (two minutes) for a device that briefly dropped off the network. Restarting the
relay empties both; the two ends reconnect and catch up from the record your IDE keeps locally.

## What your phone can do

A paired phone can: read the conversation, send messages, answer approvals, approve or send back
plans, answer questions, stop a turn, open a new conversation, add, remove and reconnect MCP servers,
and choose, rename or forget one of the Codex accounts already on the machine.

A paired phone **cannot**: run shell commands, install, enable or disable plugins, change the approval
mode of a conversation, add a new account or sign in, change the path to the Codex executable, read or
write your machine's clipboard, open files or links on your machine, or revoke or pair devices.

This is enforced on your machine rather than in the phone's interface: a message the plugin does not
explicitly permit is refused, including kinds of message that do not exist yet.

One specific case is worth naming. Approving a plan puts that conversation into "auto" - Codex's
workspace sandbox, where edits inside the project and ordinary commands go ahead and anything beyond
the sandbox still asks - whether it was approved at your desk or from your phone. It never moves a
conversation into full access.

## Pairing and revoking

Pairing happens by scanning a QR code shown in the IDE. The code's secret lives in the part of the
address after the `#`, which browsers never send to a server - so it cannot reach the relay's logs
even in principle. The code is valid for three minutes and works once, and the IDE asks you to confirm
the pairing, showing a fingerprint you can compare with the one on your phone.

Revoking a device is immediate and local: the IDE forgets its key, and from that moment the device's
messages cannot be opened. Nothing has to reach the phone, so **it works even if the phone is switched
off or lost.**

## Notifications

If you turn notifications on, the relay stores, for each device: a push endpoint (a URL provided by
Apple or Google that identifies your device to them), the keys the browser uses for push encryption,
and timestamps. The **text of a notification is encrypted by your IDE** and decrypted on your phone -
the relay passes it through without being able to read it.

Apple or Google will see that a notification was delivered to your device from this relay, its
(encrypted) size and the time.

## Retention

- Messages: held only while the other side is briefly offline, at most **two minutes**, in memory.
- Push subscriptions: until you turn notifications off or revoke the device.
- Server logs: what happened, the first four bytes of an address, sizes and times. Kept **7 days**.
  Message contents are never logged - not even in error paths.

## Running your own relay

The relay's source is published separately under Apache-2.0, and the plugin lets you point at any
address. If you do, everything on this page becomes "logs on your own server" instead.

See the relay's README for how to deploy it - by Docker, by Node, or on any host that can run a
small Node service.

## Feedback

The panel has a form for telling the plugin's author something - a bug, an idea, or nothing in
particular. It sends only when you press Send, and it sends only these things:

- **What you wrote**, and which of the three kinds you picked.
- **Your email address, if you filled it in.** It is optional, it is kept on your machine so you need
  not type it twice, and it is used to answer you and for nothing else. Nothing is ever sent to it by
  the plugin itself.
- **The files you attached**, if you attached any.
- **A debug report**, if you left that switch on. It is offered with a bug report only - on an idea or
  a hello the switch is off and cannot be turned on, because there is nothing for the report to describe.

The debug report is the part worth being exact about. It contains: the plugin's version, your IDE and
its build, your operating system and processor architecture, the version of Codex, an outline of
what the current conversation did, anything that failed, and a few counts of what the plugin did on its
own - how many messages a conversation was opened with, for instance, or that a batch of them did not
reach the panel.

The outline is a list of shapes rather than contents - "a Read call, 118 bytes in, 4 kilobytes back, at
this many seconds". It does **not** contain your messages, the agent's answers, the contents of any
file, the commands it ran, the paths on your disk, the names of your files, your project's name, or
your Codex account. File names appear only as twelve characters of a hash, so that the same file reads
as the same file without saying which one it is.

You can read the whole report before sending it: the form has "See exactly what gets attached", and
what it shows is the entire string that travels. There is no fuller version kept back for the wire.

It goes to `feedback.mzpizote.com`, a small service run by the plugin's author on the same server as
the relay, which forwards it to the author's Telegram and keeps nothing itself. Its logs record that a
message arrived, roughly how big it was and when - never what was in it. Once forwarded, the message
lives in that Telegram chat for as long as the author keeps it.

## Voice input

Voice input is off when the plugin is installed. Turning it on needs a Deepgram key of your own -
there is no service of ours in the middle, and no account with us to have one.

**Your key** is kept in your operating system's keychain through the IDE's password safe, never in a
settings file. The panel itself is never given it: the settings screen is shown the last four
characters, which is enough to tell one key from another and no use to anyone reading them off your
screen.

**While a dictation runs**, the audio from your microphone is streamed to `api.deepgram.com` over an
encrypted connection, and the words come back as text. That is the only thing that leaves your machine,
and it happens only between the moment a dictation starts and the moment it ends - the microphone is
opened when you start one and released when it finishes, so no other application is locked out of it in
the meantime and nothing is listening while you are not dictating.

**Nothing is recorded.** The audio is not written to disk, not kept in memory past the moment it is
sent, and not logged; the words come back into the input field and are yours from then on. The plugin's
own debug report never contains any of it - what a dictation writes there is that one happened, in
which language, at what sample rate.

What Deepgram does with the audio is between you and Deepgram: they are the processor here, under
whatever terms your account with them says. The plugin sends the audio, the chosen language and nothing
else - no file names, no project name, no part of your conversation.

**Dictating from your phone** works the same way, with one difference: the phone records with its own
microphone and streams to Deepgram itself, so the audio never crosses the relay. The key stays in the
keychain on your machine; what the phone is given is a token that expires after a minute and can do
nothing but transcribe - it cannot read the account, and it is worthless by the time a phone left
somewhere is opened. Your IDE refuses to issue one at all unless voice input is switched on there and a
key has been added. Everything else about voice input is unreachable from a phone: no message opens the
microphone on your work machine.

**The hotkeys** are read from the IDE's own event queue, and only while an IDE window has the keyboard.
The plugin installs no system-wide hook and asks for no accessibility permission: a key pressed in
another application is never seen by it.

## Usage statistics

Usage statistics are off until you say otherwise. The panel asks once, with a small card above the input
field and two buttons, Allow and No thanks, and nothing is sent until you press Allow. You can change the
answer at any time: menu → Settings → Usage statistics. The same screen shows the whole report as it
would go next, so you can read exactly what leaves before allowing it and at any point after.

**When.** The first report goes when you press Allow, and after that a few times a day, but only while
you are using the panel: a message sent, an answer finished or the panel opened is what sets one off. An
IDE left open and idle sends nothing. Each report carries the days that changed since the last one,
going back at most two weeks and never to a day before you allowed it.

**What is sent.** For each day:

- counts: minutes with something going on in the panel, messages sent, answers finished and how long
  Codex worked on them in total, conversations, the longest one in minutes, forks, edits that landed and
  the lines they added and removed, how many distinct files were edited (a number, not which files),
  permission questions and how many were refused, plans approved, task lists finished, attachments and
  quotes, messages sent from a paired phone and how many things were done from it in all (messages,
  answers, approvals, stops, as one number), how often a paired phone started following the work, how
  often the five-hour limit ran out, and the most MCP servers connected and plugins installed at once;
- how long each stretch of work lasted, in minutes. A stretch ends at a gap of more than half an hour.
  When a stretch began is not sent;
- which of the panel's features were used and how many times: the voice button, a fork, the history
  screen, a scenario run, trusting a project, a setting changed and so on, named from a fixed list the
  plugin defines;
- the tools Codex used, under the names the panel shows them by (Read, Edit, Bash and so on), with every
  MCP tool counted as one "MCP";
- the models that answered, by their name in Codex's own list, such as `gpt-5.6-sol` or `o3`. A model you
  added to the panel by hand travels as "Other", and so does any name that does not look like one of
  OpenAI's;
- the panel's built-in commands used, such as `/compact`, `/review` or `/init`, with your own prompts
  (`/prompts:...`) and skills counted as "custom".

And once per report:

- the versions of the plugin, your IDE and the Codex CLI, your operating system's family and processor
  architecture, and the panel's language;
- how the panel is set up: whether remote access and voice input are on, the input field's layout, the
  send key, the theme, the mode new chats start in, whether tabs come back on start, how many Codex
  accounts and paired phones there are, and similar. These travel as the plugin's own words, as counts, or
  as yes and no. Where a setting holds something you typed, such as a custom model's name or your own
  improve-prompt text, only whether it is set is sent;
- a random identifier, made on your machine when you press Allow. It is derived from nothing: not your
  hardware, not your account, not your name. Its only job is to tell one machine's days from another's.
  All JetBrains IDEs on one machine share it, as they share the answer to the question. It is this
  plugin's own: if you also use Amazing Claude Code GUI, that plugin asks its own question and makes its
  own identifier, and nothing links the two.

**What is never sent**: your messages or the agent's answers, code, file names, paths, project names,
the names of your own prompts, skills, MCP servers or the models you added, your Codex or ChatGPT
account, your email address or API key, token counts, costs, and the time of day you work.

The counts come from the statistics the plugin already keeps on your machine for its Statistics tab.
That file stays where it is; the report picks numbers out of it by name and copies nothing else.

**Where it goes.** To `usage.mzpizote.com`, a service run by the plugin's author on the same server as
the relay (OVH, Virginia, United States). It is the same service that receives the statistics of Amazing
Claude Code GUI, the plugin this one is forked from. Each report says which of the two plugins sent it,
and the service keeps their figures apart: every stored row is marked with its plugin, the two are never
added together, and a deletion asked for by one plugin cannot touch the other's. It stores the counts
under the random identifier and nothing else. It does not store your IP address: the address is
used only in memory, to limit how many reports one address can send in an hour, and the service's log
shows its first few characters. Reports are kept for two years and then deleted automatically. The
author reads them as totals across all machines, on a page behind a password.

**Turning it off.** Switching it off stops the reports at once, in every JetBrains IDE on the machine,
and asks the service to delete everything this plugin sent under your identifier. If the service cannot
be reached at that moment, the plugin keeps asking until it confirms, even with the reports off. The
identifier is forgotten too: if you allow the reports again later, a new one is made, and nothing links
it to the old one.

## Several Codex accounts

You can add more than one Codex account - a ChatGPT sign-in or an API key - and switch between them
without signing out of any of them. Doing so adds nothing to what leaves your machine.

**Each account is an ordinary `codex login`.** Codex itself writes, refreshes and reads its sign-in the
way it always has - `auth.json` in its home folder. For an added account that home is a folder of its
own under `~/.amazing-codex/accounts/`, and the plugin points Codex at it with `CODEX_HOME` when it
starts a process for that account. The ordinary sign-in in `~/.codex` is left exactly where it is.

**What the plugin reads, and what it does not do with it.** To put a name on each row it reads that
account's `auth.json` on your machine: the address and the plan named inside the ID token, or the last
four characters of an API key. That file is never copied, never changed by the plugin, and never sent
anywhere. Beside it the plugin keeps a label - the name you gave the account, the address, the plan and
the name of its folder - in one plain file (`~/.amazing-codex/accounts.json`), so that every JetBrains
IDE on the machine reads the same list. That file holds no credential.

**`~/.codex` stays one place.** An account's folder holds its `auth.json` and links to everything else
in `~/.codex` - `config.toml`, sessions, skills, prompts, logs - and Codex's own databases are pointed at
`~/.codex` as well. So your config, your MCP servers, your skills and custom prompts and the whole
conversation history are the same whichever account is in force; only the sign-in differs. Removing an
account deletes its folder and nothing it links to.

**Nothing about accounts is sent anywhere.** The list is not in a feedback report: the debug buffer
records shapes only - that an account was added, that the current one changed, that it changed in
another IDE, that a turn was stopped so a conversation could move - never an address, a folder or a
credential. Today's token count remains a figure for the whole machine rather than per account,
because it is counted from Codex's session files, which carry no account marker.

**Your phone** can see the accounts' names and choose, rename or forget one of them, because choosing
where the work runs is exactly what one reaches for when a limit is used up away from the desk. It
cannot add an account or sign in: that happens in a terminal and a browser on your machine.

## Your choices

- Remote access is off by default; the plugin does nothing over the network until you turn it on.
- Feedback is sent only when you press Send, and only what the form lists - with the debug report shown
  to you in full beforehand, and switchable off.
- You can revoke any paired device at any time, from the panel: menu → Remote access.
- You can reset this IDE's identity entirely, which drops every pairing at once.
- You can run your own relay.
- Voice input is off by default, needs a key of your own, and records only while you are dictating.
  Removing the key ("Forget this key") takes it out of the keychain.
- Usage statistics are sent only after you press Allow, and you can read the whole report first. Turning
  them off in Settings stops them and deletes what this plugin already sent.
