 * The arithmetic behind the statistics tab: out of the day records the IDE keeps, everything the tiles,

 *
 * The days are the machine's, not one project's: they arrive already folded together (see
 * StatsSnapshot.daysTogether on the plugin's side), so every figure here is about the person's work
 * wherever it was done. The one thing counted by project is where the hours went, and it reads the
 * minutes the projects carry alongside the days.
 *
 * Pure functions over the message, so the range switches without a trip to the IDE and the whole of it
 * can be checked in a test. The words go in the components; here are the numbers.
