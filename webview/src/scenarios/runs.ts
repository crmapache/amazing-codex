 * hand: a breathing dot over a run that was parked promises work that is not going on. The exception is
 * a pause laid over an open question - the question can still be answered (see the note about pausing a
 * card standing on one), so it keeps calling.
 *
 * [live] is whether the machine still lists this run among the ones going, and it beats the record. A
 * summary is read off the disk, and an IDE closed in the middle of a step leaves the last state it wrote
 * there for ever - so a row drawn from the shelf alone breathes over work that ended in the night. Said
