 * ./index), and anything on screen that imported this would put them all back into both bundles - about
 * 90 KB gzip of words nobody will read, which on a phone is roughly two fifths of a first load.
 *
 * `Record<Locale, Dict>` for the same reason the loaders are: a language in the picker with no dictionary
 * behind it should not compile.
