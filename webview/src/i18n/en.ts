/**
 * Everything the panel says, in English - and the source of truth for every other language.
 *
 * The shape is the contract. Every other dictionary is declared as `Dict`, which is `typeof en`, so the
 * compiler - not a reviewer - is what fails when a key is missing, a key is spelled differently, or a
 * string that takes a number is translated as a plain string. A dictionary cannot be half-finished here
 * the way a properties file can.
 *
 * Rules for writing entries:
 *
 * - Anything with a value in it is a function, not a template with `{0}` in it. The argument gets a name,
 *   the compiler checks the call, and a translator sees what they are given rather than a numbered hole.
 * - Grouped by where it is read, not by what type of word it is: everything the menu says is under
 *   `menu`, everything the composer says is under `composer`. Somebody translating works screen by
 *   screen, and a screen scattered across the file is a screen translated inconsistently.
 * - Product names stay as they are in every language: Codex, MCP, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, Git, PR.
 *   So do the names of the CLI's own tools (READ, EDIT, BASH) - they are identifiers, not words.
 * - The house dash is a plain hyphen with spaces around it, as the English copy has always written it.
 *   Every translation keeps that rather than reaching for its own typographic dash.
