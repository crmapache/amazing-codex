 * Saying thanks: a heart at the far end of the row opposite MODEL/EFFORT/MODE, and behind it the panel's
 * own dropdown with the three ways to do it - a star on GitHub, a review on the plugin's page, or a word
 * to somebody who has not heard of it.
 *
 * A link rather than a real star in one press: GitHub has no address that stars a repository by being
 * opened - it is a write to the account, and to do it from here the plugin would have to ask a person for
 * permission to write to their repositories. Trading that for a star is a bad bargain, so the button
 * honestly opens the page and the star is pressed there.
 *
 * Where the button stands is decided by the layout, not by this file: in bottom and compact it stands at
 * the end of the selectors' row, in left/right it stands in the rail's row of buttons. The same box either
 * way, framed in the row and borderless in the rail (see .thanks / .thanksRail and Composer.tsx).
