 * seven words of it. That used to be what the hover hint was for - it carried the whole text - and a
 * hundred lines in a hint the width of a hint is a strip of twenty characters down the window, cut off
 * at its edge (see chipTitle). Here the text is in the feed instead: it is selected, copied and found
 * by the browser's own search, and the phone - which has no hover at all and so had no way to see a
 * paste whatsoever - opens it with the same tap.
 *
 * And precisely because it opens, the collapsed chip carries no hint at all - it is the one chip in the
 * panel without one. A hint that repeats the first lines of the text stands over the feed at the very
 * moment the click puts those same lines into it, so it covers the answer it was previewing; and the
 * click itself needs no announcing, since the caret says the chip folds the same way a folded group of
 * calls does.
 *
 * [block] is a paste with nothing after it in the message: the room is free anyway, so the collapsed
 * form takes the whole width and shows the first lines rather than seven words. Standing in the middle
 * of a message it stays an ordinary chip, and the text it opens goes below it on a line of its own.

 * memo for the same reason as the ordinary chip: the feed repaints on every chunk of a printing answer,
