 * and an error is a line from a process rather than markdown. An address, though, has to stay an address:
 * the link to the service status in "API Error … check https://status.claude.com" is clicked rather than
 * retyped into a browser by hand.
 *
 * A path is the same kind of thing (see PathLink). A person who pasted `src/useSocket.js:15` into the
 * field meant that place more plainly than anyone, and a stack trace in an error is a list of them.
