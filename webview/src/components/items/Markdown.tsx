 * Parsed markdown on screen - one and the same for the agent's answer and for a plan.
 *
 * A plan used to be drawn with a simplified "number + line" layout of its own, and its markup was lost
 * entirely: bold text showed up as asterisks, nested items became steps of equal standing with new
 * numbering, and everything that was not a list item (section headings, explanatory paragraphs)
 * disappeared altogether. Here both show one and the same thing - what the agent wrote.
 *
 * `reveal` switches on the word-by-word reveal wave: a printing answer needs it, while a finished plan,
 * which appears all at once, is only hindered by it.
