 * design of this screen. Stored as a value it would be a copy: the day the built-in text improves, everyone
 * who once opened this screen would keep the old one, for no reason they could ever guess at. Stored as
 * nothing, with the placeholder saying what nothing means, the default stays a default and is still
 * readable - which is what makes it worth editing rather than guessing about.
 *
 * Saved on leaving the field rather than on every keystroke: this goes into the IDE's settings, and a
 * setting rewritten thirty times a sentence is thirty writes for one decision.
