 * The panel's opening: the ACX monogram writing itself out, its rays catching light, and the panel's
 * three voices circling it - the conversation in moon blue, a fork in aquamarine, a subagent in iris -
 * over the plugin's name. It plays once per page, while the panel underneath is still asking the IDE
 * whether Codex is there and signed in, and melts away once that answer is in.
 *
 * A layer over the whole page rather than a screen inside App (main.tsx renders it beside the panel).
 * Inside App it would sit in one of two different trees - the sign-in gate before the answer, the panel
 * after - and the switch between them, which is exactly the moment it covers, would mount it anew and
 * start the whole scene over. So the panel reports that it is ready (markPanelReady) instead of the
 * splash being told through props.
 *
 * The same monogram as the tool window's button (src/main/resources/icons/toolWindow.svg), on the same
 * 20x20 grid, and painted with the panel's own accents rather than the logo's indigo: this is the inside of
 * the panel, where the plate would be the one thing on the screen in colours nothing else here uses. The
 * accents are roles, so the light theme repaints the whole scene without a line of its own.
 *
 * Everything moves on CSS alone - see splash.module.css for the timeline and for how an orbit is made of
 * two swings.
