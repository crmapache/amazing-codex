/**
 * The road of a going run: (✓)-(✓)-(3)-(4)-(5).
 *
 * Every card of every pass is a stop - ticked when it is done, crossed when it failed, dashed when a loop
 * ended before it was needed, numbered while it is ahead. The stop the run is on keeps its number, ringed
 * and filled in the tone of what the run is doing (working, waiting for you); on a pause it is grey. Its
 * card's name is in the hint over it, not beside it: a stop that grows a label pushes every stop after it
 * along and makes the row uneven. The stage it belongs to is tinted behind it, so the stage named over the
 * road can be found on it. A finished run's road has no present: nothing is ringed in a tone and nothing is
 * tinted - the ticks, the cross where it stopped and the dashes of what it never reached say it.
 *
 * The stops stand at one short distance from each other, whatever the card's width - a road stretched
 * across a wide card reads as gaps, not as a road. What fits is decided by measuring (see
 * scenarios/roadmap.ts): a road too long for the card folds its past and its future into counts and keeps
 * the present. Measured before the paint, so a panel dragged narrow never shows a frame of stops pushed
 * past the card's edge - the road's own width does not depend on what it draws, so the answer after a fold
 * is the answer before it.
 *
 * Its stylesheet is its own: the phone draws the same road, and the hub's stylesheet would come with it.
