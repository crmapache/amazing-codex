 * weight of their own, next to letters set in ours - which is what a hotkey looked like before. A drawing
 * takes the colour and the size of the line it stands in and looks the same on every machine.
 *
 * Which key carries a sign and which carries a word is decided in the IDE for a voice binding (see
 * HotkeyBinding.kt): a Mac prints ⌥ and ⌘ and spells Ctrl and Shift out, Windows prints its own key,
 * Linux has Super. The search window's foot builds its caps itself, by the same rule (see Search.tsx).
