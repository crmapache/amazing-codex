/**
 * Hover that survives a fast hand.
 *
 * Moved across two neighbouring buttons quickly, the highlight in the IDE stayed on the one the hand had
 * left. What fixed it in the end was a short transition on the hovered colours (see sideMenu.module.css):
 * this browser draws offscreen and repaints when something asks it to, and an instant colour swap asks
 * once - a request that can be missed - while a transition asks over several frames. This hook was the
 * other half of that attempt and is kept because it costs nothing and covers the other possible cause:
 * `:hover` is a state recomputed from pointer positions, and positions can be dropped, while `mouseover`
 * is an event that still arrives.
 *
 * It is applied once for a whole panel rather than per button: the element the event lands on is marked
 * with `data-hover`, and the styles answer to that beside `:hover` - so a browser where `:hover` works
 * loses nothing. The mark is put on directly rather than through React state: this fires on every pointer
 * move across the panel, and a re-render of the whole menu per move is a price with nothing to show for
 * it (the dropdown menu keeps its own highlight in state for the same reason - see Menu).
 *
 * The container comes either as a ref (the node is already in place by the time the effect runs - see
 * SideMenu) or as the node itself, held in state by whoever renders it. The second shape is for a
 * container that appears later than the first render: a ref filled after the fact never reaches the
 * effect, because the ref object it depends on has not changed (see App and its panel, which is not
 * rendered at all until the login has been checked).
