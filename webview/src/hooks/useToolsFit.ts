 * - `group` / `groups` - a group of squares and the block of groups, measured for their gaps;
 * - `spacer` - the stretch between the squares and the sending buttons, which absorbs what is to spare;
 * - `clip` - the part of a caption a sending button gives up when it narrows (see firstLetter);
 * - `name` - the file name on the editor's chip, which steps out of the row before any square does.
