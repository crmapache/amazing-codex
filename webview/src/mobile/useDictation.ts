 * a second on a good network, and that is the half second people begin talking in. The chunks wait in
 * dictation.ts until the socket is up and then go in one go.
 *
 * The words land through a callback the composer registers rather than through state: the draft belongs
 * to the field (see mobile/screens/Composer), and a phrase has to join it wherever the caret is.
