 * step opens its own conversation, cut to the end of it on the way over (see RemoteFeed.trimmedLog).
 *
 * How it ended goes the other way - at the bottom, under the last step. The failure and the two doors out
 * of a finished run are the last thing that happened, and standing over the timeline they read as the
 * first: the error of the fifth card above the first, and "continue" before a line of what there is to
 * continue. Read top to bottom, the screen is the night in the order it went.
 *
 * The one thing that honestly does not travel is the line of what a card's agent is saying THIS SECOND: it
 * is the one field of a run that changes four times a second, and carrying it would cost somebody's mobile
