 * app knowing nothing - which is why a short code typed in here exists at all.
 *
 * The short code has less in it than the scanned one, and what makes that acceptable is the same thing
 * that makes a scan acceptable: the IDE still asks a person to confirm, showing a fingerprint to
 * compare. Neither route grants access by itself.
