 * was that choosing an account decides what every future conversation runs on, and that was the wrong
 * comparison: an account is not a preference, it is the answer to "whose subscription is paying", and
 * the person paying is the one holding the phone. Running a five-hour window dry in the evening with a
 * second account signed in and no way to reach it is exactly the situation this channel exists for.
 *
 * What it costs is said before it is pressed, not after: switching moves every open conversation on that
 * machine onto the new account and stops any turn in the middle of running. That sentence stands under
 * the button, and the button asks again.
