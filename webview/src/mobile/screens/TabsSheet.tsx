 * to be at the far end as at the near one. Pressed on the tab already open, the strip opens this.
 *
 * A fork is indented under what it grew out of and carries its group's colour bar - the same two marks
 * the panel's own tabs use, and for the same reason: a fork holds its parent's whole transcript, so
 * answering in one rather than the other is answering somewhere else entirely.
