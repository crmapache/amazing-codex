 * Seven of them now (tabs, the run's settings, a message's actions, commands, files, limits, the
 * scenarios' four) and they were on their way to being seven copies of the same forty lines: a scrim, a
 * grab handle, a header with a cross, a body that scrolls, a footer that respects the home indicator.
 * What differs between them is the content, and everything that does not differ belongs in one place -
 * the first thing to drift otherwise is the one that matters, which is that the sheet stops short of the
 * bottom of the screen.
 *
 * Pulling it down closes it (see useSheetDrag): the handle at the top promises that gesture, and a sheet
 * that draws the handle and ignores the pull reads as stuck. The scrim and the cross remain.
 *
 * A sheet rather than a screen wherever the answer is "pick one of these and come back". A screen costs
 * the way back and the loss of what is behind it; the two things a phone is worst at.
