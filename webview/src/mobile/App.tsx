 * needs. A conversation with a fork in it had no way to reach the fork. A turn running twelve subagents
 * said "working" and nothing else. A server that fell over stopped the work with no way to see it, and
 * an account whose window ran dry could not be swapped for the one signed in beside it.
 *
 * So there are more screens, and each of them earns its place by a question somebody away from the desk
 * genuinely has. What is still absent is absent on purpose and mostly on the other side of the wire as
 * well (see RemoteCommands): installing plugins, signing in to anything, and every machine-wide setting.
