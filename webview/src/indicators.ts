 * another - somebody on a plan without an extra limit has no use for its ring, somebody who never
 * looks at the token count would rather have the width. So each one is a switch of its own rather than
 * one "minimal mode" that decides for everybody which of them matters.

 * then left to right along the row under the field.

 * strip for a thumb, and has neither the counter nor the two buttons at all.
