 * paid for. From that moment the answers are signed by the other model, the bottom line names it, and
 * without this card the only visible trace of the whole story is a selector that has "switched itself"

 * So the card says three things at once: which model the conversation was on, which one it is on now,
 * and why - in the CLI's own words, the same ones the terminal shows (see AgentSystemEvent.content).
 * The reason is empty when the swap was noticed by the signature under an answer rather than announced

 * top of the plan, so the work carries on without a pause - the breakage sound, the cross and the red
 * were a false alarm about work that never stopped. And when it does stop, an error is still the wrong
 * word: nothing is broken and there is nothing to fix, one waits for the window - so the row says when.
 *
 * Hence two kinds rather than one:
 * - `extra` - the limit is used up, the work goes on for money. It stays in the feed: this is the mark
 *   of the moment the money started, and the ring in the composer's row is painted for as long as it
 *   lasts (see UsageMeters). The moment itself gets a sound of its own - not an alarm about a halt, but
 *   the one notice that the spending has begun (see sounds.ts).
 * - `waiting` - the work has genuinely stopped until [resetsAt]. It goes away by itself at that moment:
