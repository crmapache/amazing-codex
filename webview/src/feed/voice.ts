 * after the message has gone. So they live here with a test on them rather than inside a component.
 *
 * Phrases arrive one after another while somebody is speaking, and each is appended to the end of the
 * draft rather than at the caret. That is the rule people expect - dictation continues what has been
 * said - and it is also the only one that survives the caret being somewhere else entirely: the field
 * may not even have the focus, because the hotkey works from the editor.
