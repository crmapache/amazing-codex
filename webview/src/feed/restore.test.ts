 * The claim the whole of the shell's journal rests on: a client that was not there sees the same
 * conversation as one that was.
 *
 * Two feeds are built here out of the same turn. The first the way it happens live - the person's
 * message goes into the feed on the press, the answer arrives delta by delta. The second the way a
 * client joining later gets it - the message as an echo from the journal, the deltas as one fold, then
 * the same finished blocks. What comes out has to be the same feed.
 *
 * Without this the arrangement looks right and is wrong in the one way that matters: a phone showing a
 * conversation that reads differently from the one on the desk is worse than a phone showing nothing.
