 *
 * The elapsed time is written right here rather than waiting for the turn's outcome: the "Worked Ns" under a
 * finished answer arrives only with its end, and until then how much had already passed was not visible at
 * all. It is counted from the person's request less pausedMs - the total time of every such wait over this
 * work (see attentionStarted/attentionEnded in feed/build.ts and the effect in App that sends them):
 * otherwise after a decision the idle seconds would be charged to the agent retroactively, as though it had
 * been "thinking" all that time. From the request rather than from the turn because one request is many
 * turns whenever background agents are in it - see PanelState.stintStartedAt. It is updated once a second by
 * the same tick that moves the tool calls' durations (see tickDurations in feed/build.ts).
 *
 * `now` is a parameter because the two clients do not share a clock. The panel counts against its own
 * Date.now() and everything in the state was written by that same clock, so it passes nothing. The
 * phone's state, though, was built out of moments stamped by the machine with the IDE, and answering
