 * all. This rule used to be "is the active tab among the conversations, OR are there no conversations at
 * all" - and the second half is what bit. With every chat closed and a run's tab on screen - which is
 * exactly where the run's own "Continue in a chat" button is pressed - there were no conversations, so
 * the tab on screen was taken to be the panel's own spare one and the conversation was put into it. The
 * identifier it went in under belongs to the run, so the body went on drawing the run: the press
 * apparently did nothing, the conversation was live and unreachable, and there was nowhere to type.
 *
 * The empty half is kept because it is right for what it was written for: a strip with nothing in it at
 * all is the panel's own tab, and a history opened there should not leave a blank tab behind.
