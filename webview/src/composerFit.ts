 * - The status row under the field. First its far end (the usage, the bubble, the heart) steps down onto a

 *   plain CSS (see .status). Then the captions go (MODEL, EFFORT, MODE) and the values stay. Only past that
 *   do the values themselves start losing letters to an ellipsis. The far end, on its own line, has one step
 *   of its own: once even that line cannot hold the usage and the pair, the bubble and the heart go (see
 *   endPairFits).
 * - The buttons inside the field. The little squares leave one by one, least needed first - the slash, the
 *   search, the sparkle, the microphone - and only once all four are gone do Queue and Send start to narrow,
 *   down to a single letter each.
 *
 * Kept apart from the components because it breaks quietly: a row that sheds a button one pixel too early
 * looks deliberate, one that sheds it a pixel too late pushes Send past the panel's edge, and one that
 * answers differently to its own last answer flickers under the mouse while the panel is being dragged.
