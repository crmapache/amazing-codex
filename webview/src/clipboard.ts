/**
 * The clipboard bridge between the page and the IDE.
 *
 * The panel is an embedded browser, and its clipboard is its own. On Linux it is besides connected to
 * nothing: the browser renders without a window of its own, while there the system clipboard is owned
 * precisely by a window - having got no ownership, the browser silently starts an internal clipboard and
 * lives with it. From outside that looks as though copying works only inside the input field: cut and
 * paste in the same place and it works, copy in a code tab and paste into the panel and it is empty, and
 * the other way round too. That is exactly what the first report was about.
 *
 * We fix it not by replacing everything but by going around the broken place: the real clipboard is
 * available to the shell (it is the same one the whole IDE uses), so a copy is duplicated into it and a
 * paste is taken out of it. Where the native route works (macOS, Windows) we do not touch it at all: the
 * bridge is Linux-only, and there the native clipboard can do more than ours.
 *
 * **On the bridge the browser's own clipboard is not believed at all**, and that is the second report.
 * At first a paste was filled in only where the browser handed over emptiness - which held right up to
 * the first copy made inside the panel: that fills the private clipboard for good, it is refreshed by
 * nothing afterwards, and every later paste got that one snapshot back instead of what had since been
 * copied in the editor. Why the system clipboard is the one to ask, and what the browser's snapshot is
 * still kept for, is in clipboardContent.
 */

 * How long the shell's answer is waited for before the clipboard counts as empty.
