            <h2>Why this one</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>A round of work, written once and run for you.</b> Scenarios: a few cards, each
              a Codex thread of its own - implement, review, fix, run the tests - in stages that can
              go round more than once, with a main thread walking them and judging what each one found.
              Run one by button, three at once against three tickets, or on a clock at nine every
              weekday with its questions answered in advance. Describe the round in a sentence and
              Codex reads the project and writes the form.</li>
              <li><b>The whole panel from your phone, not just a "yes" button.</b> Answer an approval
              or a plan, open a project that is closed, read yesterday's chat, fork, change the model
              and the effort, switch the account, watch a scenario run and unblock it. Off by default,
              paired by QR code, end-to-end encrypted through a relay that cannot read a word, revoked
              in one tap.</li>
              <li><b>Several Codex accounts, switched in one click.</b> Work and personal on one machine
              without signing out of either - each keeps its own sign-in, while history, config and
              skills stay shared. Every row shows what is left of that account's limits, and Select
              moves every open chat onto it.</li>
              <li><b>Search across every conversation of the project.</b> Prefixes, typos, word stems,
              phrases in quotes; this chat or all of them, with a jump straight to the message in its
              chat. When words are not enough, describe what you are looking for and Codex reads the
              conversations for you.</li>
              <li><b>Everything it does is on screen.</b> Every command with its duration, every patch
              as an open diff with real line numbers, the plan ticking off, web searches, MCP tool
              calls, and what the turn cost in tokens. A retried request or a used-up limit is a card
              with the reason and the countdown, not silence.</li>
              <li><b>Nothing answers for you, and nothing is lost.</b> An approval, a plan or a
              question waits as long as it takes - no timeout, no auto-continue. Conversations keep
              going with the panel collapsed or the project switched, and messages written during a
              turn are steered into it or wait in a queue the IDE keeps.</li>
              <li><b>Android Studio included</b>, along with every JetBrains IDE from 2026.1 on.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Also in the panel</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Point at files, do not type them.</b> Drag one in, type <code>@</code> to pick it,
              paste a screenshot or a long log - each lands as a chip you cannot mistype.</li>
              <li><b>Send code with its address.</b> Select lines, "Send to Amazing Codex GUI",
              and the agent reads the real file around them instead of a snippet with no context.</li>
              <li><b>Paths open files.</b> A path anywhere in the conversation - the head of a card, an
              answer, an error, your own message - opens the file in the editor at the line it names;
              an edit opens on the edit itself.</li>
              <li><b>Grab any part of an answer.</b> Quote it into your next message, fork the
              conversation from that exact point, pin up to three messages above the chat, or take a
              sent message back into the field to fix and resend.</li>
              <li><b>Model, reasoning effort and approval mode change mid-conversation</b>, per tab,
              without restarting anything: ask every time, auto, read-only, plan, or full access. The
              effort menu offers exactly the levels the chosen model has.</li>
              <li><b>MCP servers and plugins</b> on screens of their own: which server is up, which
              wants a sign-in, which fell over and why.</li>
              <li><b>History</b> of this project's past Codex threads, terminal ones included, opened
              from the end and paged back on demand.</li>
              <li><b>Codex's own commands</b> - <code>/compact</code>, <code>/review</code>,
              <code>/init</code>, <code>/new</code>, your custom prompts and skills - in the field's
              suggestions.</li>
              <li><b><code>!</code> runs a command in your own shell</b>, and the output travels with
              your next message, costing no turn and no approval.</li>
              <li><b>Improve prompt</b> - the sparkle rewrites your draft in a run of its own, costing
              your conversation no context, and one button puts your words back.</li>
              <li><b>Voice input</b> with a Deepgram key of your own: hold a hotkey, even from the
              editor.</li>
              <li><b>Sound alerts</b> for the moments worth one, and only when you are not already
              looking.</li>
              <li><b>Statistics</b> of hours, habits and achievements, shareable as a picture.</li>
              <li><b>Ten languages</b>, following your IDE by default.</li>
              <li><b>Your unsaved buffers</b> are written before a turn, and files the agent changed
              are re-read at once.</li>
              <li><b>A side panel, not an editor tab</b>, on any edge of the window; numbers pick an
              option, Shift+Tab cycles the mode, Escape stops the turn.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Privacy and transparency</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Everything runs on your machine.</b> No proxy, no server of ours in the middle.
              Your Codex sign-in belongs to the CLI - the plugin never sends it anywhere and never hunts
              for API keys on your disk.</li>
              <li><b>No telemetry, no analytics, no account.</b> With remote access off, the only thing
              that ever leaves is a feedback report you write and send yourself - and one button shows
              its exact text first.</li>
              <li><b>Your rules stay yours.</b> Codex applies your config, its sandbox and its approval
              policy; the mode on screen is exactly the policy the thread runs with, and the plugin
              never starts a thread in a laxer one.</li>
              <li><b>Source available</b> on GitHub under the Elastic License 2.0, and the
              <a href="https://github.com/crmapache/amazing-codex/blob/main/PRIVACY.md">privacy policy</a> lists everything that can
              leave the machine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>Codex CLI installed (<code>npm install -g @openai/codex</code>) and signed in, and any
            JetBrains IDE from 2026.1 on, Android Studio included. Android Studio has no embedded
            browser of its own, so the IDE offers to install JetBrains' browser plugin alongside this
            one.</p>
