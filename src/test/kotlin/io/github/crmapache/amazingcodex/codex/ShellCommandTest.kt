/**
 * A bash-mode command is genuinely run here - there is no other way to check the main thing: that it
 * goes into the user's shell, sees the project's working directory and honestly returns the exit code.
 *
 * We check "contains" rather than "equals exactly": the command goes into a person's shell along with
 * their profile, and many people's profiles print something of their own - a version manager's
 * greeting, a status line, a corporate banner. A test has to catch the panel breaking, not the settings
 * of whoever runs it.
 *
 * The syntax here is POSIX, while on Windows the panel calls cmd.exe (see ShellCommand.shell) - there
 * these strings mean nothing, so on it the tests are skipped entirely.
