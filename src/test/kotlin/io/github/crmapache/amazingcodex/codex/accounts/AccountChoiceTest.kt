/**
 * Which account a conversation ends up on, and which model it may run there.
 *
 * There used to be a chain of answers here - the transcript's own account, then the request's, then the
 * parent's, then the machine's. There is one now: the account chosen on this machine, for everything.
 * The rule is worth a test file of its own because every mistake in it is invisible - the conversation
 * opens, works and answers exactly as it should, and the wrong subscription pays.
 *
 * The model rides along because an account may not serve every model another one does, and a model
 * handed to a process that cannot run it fails the person's first message rather than the launch. So the
 * model is put right before the process is raised, or not at all.
