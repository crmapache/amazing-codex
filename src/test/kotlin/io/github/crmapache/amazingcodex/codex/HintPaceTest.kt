/**
 * How often the "/" hint looks at the disk again.
 *
 * It breaks silently in both directions - too eager and a share is walked without pause, too lazy and
 * the skill somebody has just written does not show up - and neither is visible on the machine it is
 * written on, where every walk is a millisecond. Hence the arithmetic apart from the timer.
