 * How an answer from `claude plugin list` is told apart from a shape we did not expect.
 *
 * The "/" hint is built from this list, and the failure it guards against is a silent one: a field
 * renamed in some later CLI reads as "no plugins installed", every plugin's commands leave the hint,
 * and nothing anywhere says why. Both doors into the list ask the same question - see [CodexPlugin].
