 * A question the agent stops a turn for is remembered until someone answers it - and a great many are
 * never answered: the tab is closed over them, the conversation is wiped, the process dies. Remembered
 * anyway, they pile up for as long as the project is open.
 *
 * There is no process at all here, so nothing is answerable - which is exactly the state a closed tab
 * leaves behind. It is also enough for the second thing tested here: whether one question can be
 * answered twice, which is what two clients pressing the same button comes down to.
