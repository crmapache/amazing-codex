/**

 * Until now there was exactly one - the panel's browser - and everything was sent straight to it. The
 * moment a second one exists (a browser window in phase 1, a phone in phase 2), three things have to
 * hold, and none of them held before: everyone sees the same feed, a client that arrives late is
 * caught up rather than left with a blank tab, and one that comes back after a break is given only
 * what it missed.
 *
 * No process is started anywhere here. The journal is fed directly, which is exactly what a
 * conversation's own stream does to it.
