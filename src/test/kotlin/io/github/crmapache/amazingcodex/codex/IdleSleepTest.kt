/**
 * Which conversation may give its process back.
 *
 * Every clause of the rule is a way to lose work silently, and none of them shows on the screen: a tab
 * holding forty background agents looks exactly like a tab holding nothing, and a question waiting for a
 * person looks like an idle one to everything except the process that asked it. What breaks here is
 * noticed hours later, as an agent that never reported and an answer that went nowhere - so the rule is
 * kept apart from the timer that runs it, and tested.
