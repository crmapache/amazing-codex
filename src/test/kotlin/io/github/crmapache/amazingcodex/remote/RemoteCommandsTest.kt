/**
 * The most valuable test in the whole of the remote access work, and the least impressive to read.
 *
 * The list of what a phone may ask for is only worth anything while it keeps pace with the protocol.
 * The protocol grows - a message a month, sometimes more - and every one of them is added by someone
 * thinking about the panel, not about a device across the city. Without something that fails, a new
 * message type becomes remotely reachable (or remotely broken) in silence, and nobody finds out until
 * it matters.
 *
 * So the protocol itself is read here, and every type in it has to have been decided about: allowed or
 * refused, on purpose, by name. Adding a message to the protocol and forgetting this file breaks the
 * build - which is the only mechanism that survives people being busy.
