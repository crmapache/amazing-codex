 * The memory of what has already been sent, and the two ways it is let go of.

 * A leak nobody sees: every row is one fingerprint, and the whole table is smaller than a single file
 * list. What makes it worth a test is that it only ever grew - a row per run, per paired device, for as
 * long as the IDE is open - and that neither half of the letting go has anything on screen to show it
 * working.
