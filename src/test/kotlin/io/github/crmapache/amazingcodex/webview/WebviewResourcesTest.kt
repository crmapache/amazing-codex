/**
 * The handler that hands the panel's own page to the embedded browser.
 *
 * It is not a class implementing the interface but a proxy built from whatever shape of that interface
 * the running IDE has, dispatching by method name (see [WebviewResources]). That is what lets one archive
 * fit both 2026.1, where the interface asks for four methods, and 2026.2, where it asks for seven - and it
 * is also what makes the failure silent. A method the browser calls and the dispatch does not name gets a
 * blank instead of an answer: no compiler complains, nothing appears in the log, the panel simply never
 * comes up. In one IDE and not the other, at that.
 *
 * So the two sides are read against each other here, the way the achievements are: the names in the
 * dispatch against the methods the interface actually declares.
