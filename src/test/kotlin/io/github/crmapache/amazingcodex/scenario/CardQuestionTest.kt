/**
 * What a card's question carries back to it, and it is the shape rather than the words that breaks.
 *
 * Written from a live run: the choice went back as a bare key of the call's own arguments, the CLI found
 * no `answers` there, and the card replied "the response didn't come through" and asked the same question
 * again. Nothing on the screen said anything was wrong - the run simply stood on a question that had been
 * answered.
