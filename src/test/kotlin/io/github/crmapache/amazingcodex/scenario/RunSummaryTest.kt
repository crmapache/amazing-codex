 * What a card of a going run says about itself.

 * device - and the band of live runs is drawn from it and from nothing else. So where the run has got to
 * is worked out here rather than sent as the whole record, and it is worth a test: read wrongly, the card
 * names a stage the road under it is not lit in, and nothing else on the screen contradicts it.
