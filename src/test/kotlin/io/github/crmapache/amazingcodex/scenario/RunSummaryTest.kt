/**
 * What a card of a going run says about itself.
 *
 * The summary is the light half of the wire - it goes out once a second to every window and every paired
 * device - and the band of live runs is drawn from it and from nothing else. So where the run has got to
 * is worked out here rather than sent as the whole record, and it is worth a test: read wrongly, the card
 * says "stage 0 of 3" over a run that is halfway through, and nothing else on the screen contradicts it.
