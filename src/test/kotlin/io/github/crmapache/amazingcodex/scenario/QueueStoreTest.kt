/**
 * The file the queue lives in, read and written the way two windows really do it.
 *
 * The one thing worth proving here is the order: a turn has to be WRITTEN as taken before anything is
 * raised, because the other IDE window beats against this same file on its own timer. A claim that says
 * it took the turn while nothing reached the disk means the next beat takes the same turn again - two sets
 * of agents in one working copy, and on the screen it looks like a night that went fine.
