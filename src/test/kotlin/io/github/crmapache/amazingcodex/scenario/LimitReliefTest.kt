/**
 * Where a run goes on when its account's limit refuses it.
 *
 * Both ways of getting this wrong cost a night. A run that waits beside an account with room is the
 * evening of 8 October again: the five-hour window of one account ran out, two more stood idle, and the run
 * stopped until somebody came back to it. A run that moves onto an account that cannot take it is refused
 * again at once - or, on an account without its model, dies on its first message.
