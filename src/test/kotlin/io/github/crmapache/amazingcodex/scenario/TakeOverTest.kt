/**
 * When the head does a card's work itself, and what it may do while the fence is down.
 *
 * Both halves fail quietly, in opposite directions. A take-over that never fires is the night ending red
 * on something the head could have finished, which is the whole reason the setting exists; one that fires
 * where it should not is the head getting past a stop the scenario put there on purpose, with nobody
 * watching.
