/**
 * What a session said each time it meant to end its turn (see TurnEndings).
 *
 * Written from a live run: a roas-radar card finished with a full report, the project's style hook sent it
 * back for one more pass, and the head was shown only the note about that pass - so it sent the finished
 * card back for the report. The lines below keep the shape the CLI records: the text arrives in
 * `assistant` events with no stop reason, and the reason only in the stream's `message_delta`.
