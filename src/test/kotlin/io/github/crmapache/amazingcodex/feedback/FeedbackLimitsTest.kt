/**
 * The same three ceilings are written in three places - the panel greys out the Send button by them, the
 * plugin refuses files by them, and the service refuses a whole request by them - and nothing else would
 * notice if they drifted apart.
 *
 * Drift is not harmless in either direction. Raise it in the plugin alone and the panel keeps refusing
 * what would now go; lower it in the service alone and the panel promises a file will travel while the
 * server throws the request away. So the numbers are watched by reading the other sides' own sources, the
 * way this project already watches the sounds, the achievements and what a phone may ask for (see
 * RemoteCommandsTest).
