/**
 * The one request this plugin makes of the internet, against a real server on this machine.
 *
 * The body is multipart assembled by hand - there is no builder for it in the JDK - and a body assembled
 * by hand is wrong in ways that only show up at the other end: a missing CRLF, a boundary that appears
 * inside a file, a filename with a quote in it that turns the rest of the request into headers. None of
 * that can be caught by reading the code, so here the request is genuinely sent and genuinely read.
