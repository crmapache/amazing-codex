/**
 * The report's promise, as a test.
 *
 * Everything here is one question asked in several ways: given a journal that holds the whole of a
 * conversation - what a person typed, what the agent answered, the contents of the files it read, the
 * paths those files live at - does any of it come out the other side?
 *
 * This is the test to run when anything about the report changes. The screen tells people that nothing
 * private travels; if that stops being true, it stops being a bug and becomes a lie.
