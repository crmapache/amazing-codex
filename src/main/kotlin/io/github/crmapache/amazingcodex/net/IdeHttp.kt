/**
 * An HTTP client that goes out the way the IDE does.
 *
 * Corporate networks are the ordinary case rather than the exception, and both halves matter: the proxy
 * because there is no way out without it, the certificate store because a network that inspects TLS
 * presents a certificate the JDK's own trust store has never heard of.
 *
 * One place for all three of the plugin's ways out - the relay, the feedback report and Deepgram. It was
 * three copies of these fifteen lines, which is a very quiet way to fail: mend the proxy in one of them
 * and the other two go on being the parts of the plugin that a company's network refuses, with nothing
 * on screen to say why.
 *
 * The two halves are wrapped separately on purpose. A company that has no proxy but does have its own
 * certificate authority should not lose the second because the first was not there to be read.
