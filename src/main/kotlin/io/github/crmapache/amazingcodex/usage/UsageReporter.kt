/**
 * The anonymous usage report: whether it may go, when it goes, and taking it back.
 *
 * Nothing goes until a person has said yes (see UsageConsentCard in UsageStats.tsx, the card that asks
 * once). Then a report goes a few times a day, and only while the plugin is being used: the moments that
 * set it off are a message sent, an answer finished and the panel opening (see [nudge]), never a timer of
 * its own - an IDE left open over a weekend sends nothing. JetBrains asks exactly this of a plugin (Marketplace approval
 * guidelines, 2.2.d and 2.2.e), and it is also simply what "while you use it" means.
 *
 * Saying no later takes the past with it: the identifier is dropped, and the service is asked to delete
 * everything kept under it - retried until it answers, even with the report switched off, because a
 * deletion is the one request the switch must never stand in the way of.
