 * have to agree on what a word is. There is no shared code between Kotlin and a browser page, so this
 * is the case of Frame.kt and frame.ts - change one, change the other. Keeping the rule simple is what
 * keeps that possible.
 *
 * A word is a run of letters and digits. An underscore ends a word, so `oldest_event` is two of them,
 * and a change of case or of kind inside a run makes the parts words as well as the whole: a query for
 * "event" should find `oldestEventUuid`, which is how the conversations in a code project are written.
 * Words are matched folded - lower case, accents dropped, the Russian ё as е - because that is how
