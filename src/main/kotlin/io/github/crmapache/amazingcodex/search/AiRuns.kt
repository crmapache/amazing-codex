/**
 * The model's searches under way, by the request's number - and which of them a person has taken back.
 *
 * A cancel names a request, not a process, and the two are not the same thing for the first seconds of
 * a search: the index is brought up to date and the corpus written before any process exists. A cancel
 * that only knew processes fell into that gap and did nothing - it was not even remembered - so the run
 * started a moment later as though nobody had pressed anything, worked to the end and was paid for, and
 * its answer was thrown away by a window that had long since moved on. Here the request is known from
 * the moment it is asked, and a cancel is kept until the run it names is over, whichever comes first.
 *
 * [H] is whatever a run is stopped through; [stop] stops it. Generic so the rule can be checked without
 * a process behind it.
