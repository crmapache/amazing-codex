/**
 * The search over one project's conversations, as the clients see it: a request in, a list of hits
 * out, addressed to whoever asked (see CodexSessionHub.emitTo - what somebody is looking for is of no
 * interest to the other windows on the project).
 *
 * Three requests and one answer. A typed query is matched against the index (see SearchIndex and
 * TextIndex), in one conversation or in all of them; a described one is handed to a model with the
 * conversations as plain text (see AiSearch); and the model's run can be taken back. The answer is one
 * shape for all three, so the screen that lists the hits is one screen.
 *
 * Everything here runs off the thread the request came in on: the index reads the disk, and the model
 * runs a process.
