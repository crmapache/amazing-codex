/**
 * Everything one project's conversations said, kept where a search can reach it in a moment.
 *
 * The transcripts themselves cannot be searched as they lie: on this machine a heavy project is six
 * hundred megabytes of them, of which the words are four (see TranscriptText). So the words are taken
 * out once and kept - in memory for the search, and on disk beside the statistics so the next start of
 * the IDE does not read six hundred megabytes again. A transcript is only ever appended to, which is
 * what makes keeping up cheap: a file that grew is read from where the last reading stopped, and a
 * conversation under way costs the kilobytes it added rather than the megabytes it is.
 *
 * The copy on disk is a cache and is treated as one: a file that cannot be read is rebuilt from the
 * transcripts rather than complained about, and nothing anywhere depends on its being there.
 *
 * One instance per project, under one lock: refreshing and searching are both quick, and a search that
 * ran over a half-refreshed list would be the kind of fault nobody could reproduce.
