 * Someone watching this project's conversations.

 * Until now there was exactly one such watcher and it had no name: the panel's embedded browser, which
 * everything was sent to directly (see CodexPanel's webview.send). Naming it turns "send" into
 * "send to everyone" - and that is the whole of what a phone needs from this side.
 *
 * Messages arrive in batches rather than one at a time on purpose. On joining, a client is handed the
 * whole of what it missed at once, and a batch lets whoever delivers it decide how to pace that: the
 * browser's channel already coalesces a frame's worth into one call and cuts oversized ones into
 * pieces (see WebviewHost), and it should keep doing that rather than have a second such layer built
 * over it here.
