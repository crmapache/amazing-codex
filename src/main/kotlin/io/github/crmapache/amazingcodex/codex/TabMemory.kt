/**
 * The tabs a project had open, kept on disk so that they come back when it is opened again.
 *
 * Asked for in so many words: close the IDE - or lose it to a crash, a force-quit, a dead battery - and the
 * conversations that were open, and the half-written prompt in one of them, are gone from the panel. The
 * conversations themselves never were gone (the CLI keeps every transcript), only the list of which ones
 * were on the strip, and the draft, which lived in the page and nowhere else.
 *
 * Written on every change rather than when the project closes, and that is the whole point of the
 * design: a close is the one moment of a crash that never comes. A change is remembered at once and put
 * on disk a moment later ([WRITE_DELAY_MS]), so a burst of changes - a tab opened, named, given a model -
 * is one write, and what is lost to a kill is at most the last fraction of a second.
 *
 * The file is replaced whole through a sibling and a move, never written over in place: a process killed
 * halfway through a write in place leaves half a file, and half a file restores nothing.
 *
 * It lives in the IDE's system folder rather than in the project: a list of one's open conversations and
 * a draft of what one was about to ask are nobody else's business, and a plugin writing into a working
 * copy is a plugin one notices in `git status`.
