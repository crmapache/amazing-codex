/**
 * Finding the Claude Code executable.
 *
 * Simply taking PATH out of the process environment will not do on macOS: an application launched from
 * the Dock or from Toolbox gets a trimmed PATH without the user's own folders. So the environment is
 * taken the way a login shell sees it - which is what the IDE's own terminal does.
 *
 * And even that is not always enough: the CLI gets installed in different ways (the native installer,
 * npm, bun, volta, scoop), the file name on Windows differs too, and the IDE shell's PATH may not
 * match the terminal's. Hence the order: a path pointed at by hand, PATH, the usual install locations
 * - and if all of that comes up empty, ask the system itself (`where` / `command -v` in the user's
 * shell), which knows about installs we never guessed at.
 *
 * The path walking itself lives in [CodexLookup] - there a test can see it, without someone else's
 * machine at hand.
