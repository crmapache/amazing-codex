/**
 * What a conversation starts on when nothing was chosen for it: model, effort and context window.
 *
 * One answer for everybody who has to give it, and that is the reason this is a file of its own. The launch
 * (CodexSessions.newSession) used to know a longer road than everything that SHOWED its answer: it read
 * the paying account's memory between the pin and the machine's last pick, while the chip over an empty
 * tab, a phone's new chat and the scenarios read the pin and the last pick alone. Wherever the two differed
 * - an account switched to, a pick made in another IDE on the machine's shared register of accounts - the
 * chip said Sonnet over a tab that came up on Opus, and changed its mind at the first answer.
 *
 * The chain, strongest first:
 * - what the request itself named - a phone's new chat, a fork's parent, a tab restored with its own;
 * - the pin behind "New chats": somebody said "start on this" in words ([CodexPreferences.newTabModel]);
 * - what the paying account was last left on - picks are remembered per account, because plans differ in
 *   which models they can run (CodexAccounts.rememberChoice);
 * - the machine's last pick, for an account nobody has picked anything on yet - the ordinary sign-in,
 *   which has no record at all, among them.
 *
 * The model is then held to what that account can run ([clamp]); the effort has nothing to be held to.
 * Context uses the request, then its pin, then the machine's last pick; it has no account-specific memory.
