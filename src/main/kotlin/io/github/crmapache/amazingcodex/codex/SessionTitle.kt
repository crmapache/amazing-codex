 * of the first line of the message, and then carry that guess: a whole sentence, or a command with its
 * arguments, cut at sixty characters. The guess is a stand-in; the name is asked for (see
 * CodexSession.requestTitle), and this is the rule for what is worth asking about.

     * plugin's command and says what it is about, while the bare "/status" is the CLI's own.
