/**
 * What was sent into the process and not yet accounted for, and the rules for recovering what got
 * lost.
 *
 * Started because a message written into a running turn goes missing at the CLI without a word: it
 * takes the message, and then either starts a new turn with it, or hands it to the running one, or
 * loses it entirely - and in the last case nothing appears in the stream at all. The person sees their
 * message in the feed, no work begins, and there is nothing to explain it with (see [PromptDelivery]
 * and CodexSession.checkDeliveries).
 *
 * Apart from the session itself for two reasons. First, the list has rules of its own - one record
 * found closes one wait, resending goes one message per turn - and keeping them mixed in with starting
 * a process is pointless. Second, there is no other way to check them: the session owns a live claude
 * process and does not come up in a test, while a mistake here costs the person a lost or doubled
 * message.

     * message will wait for the end of the turn it just started.
     *
     * A send that never became a turn (the message ran out of attempts and it came to nothing but an
     * error in the panel), on the other hand, does not end the pass: otherwise the next lost message
     * after it would be waiting for the end of a turn nobody is going to start.
     *
     * A message that is already a repeat is handed over regardless of the turn: nothing more is sent
     * for it - all that is left is to say out loud that it was lost (see CodexSession.resend), and
     * saying so writes nothing into the process. Waiting for a free turn here would mean waiting
     * forever: the turn a resend declared is exactly the one that is never going to end, because the
     * repeat vanished just like the original.
     *
     * The sending itself happens outside the list's lock, and that is no detail: sending reaches into
     * the process, up into the panel and back into this very list. Holding three doors open at once is
     * enough for two chains of checks in the air to jam them into a deadlock. The lock guards what it
     * is for - taking a message out of the list, so that two chains do not pick up the same one and
     * send it to the agent twice.
