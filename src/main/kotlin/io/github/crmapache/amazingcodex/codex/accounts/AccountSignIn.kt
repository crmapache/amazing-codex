/**
 * Adding an account: a terminal for the person, and a question for the CLI.
 *
 * The sign-in itself has to be a terminal. `claude auth login` opens a browser, waits for a code to
 * come back, and may take a detour through SSO - a full dialogue with a process, which is why the panel
 * has never had a sign-in form of its own. The one thing that changes for a second account is the
 * environment that terminal is given: a credential drawer, so the sign-in lands in that account's
 * drawer instead of overwriting the one the person already has.
 *
 * The terminal itself, and why the drawer travels as a typed map rather than as a shell prefix, are
 * [AccountTerminal]'s - the Claude Design sign-in stands on the same ground.
 *
 * **How the finish is noticed, and why not the obvious way.** The terminal offers a termination
 * callback, and it is the wrong signal: it fires when the SHELL session ends, not when the command
 * inside it finishes. A person who signs in and leaves the tab open would never be noticed at all,
 * while a person who closes the tab in confusion would be noticed as a failure. So nothing is read out
 * of the terminal - not the output, not its lifetime. Instead the drawer itself is asked, every few
 * seconds, whether a credential has appeared in it. That is the same question a conversation will ask
 * later, answered by the CLI rather than inferred by us, and it is true exactly when the sign-in is
 * genuinely usable.
