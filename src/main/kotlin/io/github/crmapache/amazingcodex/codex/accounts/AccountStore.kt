/**
 * Several Claude accounts on one machine, and the one variable that keeps them apart.
 *
 * The obvious way to do this is `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: point each account at a folder of its own and the
 * CLI files their credentials separately by itself. It also files everything ELSE separately - the
 * skills, the hooks, the MCP servers, the settings, the personal commands, `projects/` with every
 * transcript in it, and with them the history, the search index and the statistics. Switching account
 * that way is switching to a stranger's machine. Verified rather than assumed: under that variable
 * `auth status` reports a different `projectsDirectory`.
 *
 * `CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR` moves the credential and nothing else. Under it `auth status`
 * answers `loggedIn:false` - it looked in a drawer we named and found nothing - while
 * `projectsDirectory` stays `~/.claude/projects`. So the folder stays one, and what travels is which
 * drawer a process opens. It is per process, which is the whole prize: two conversations on two
 * accounts run at the same time, because nothing global is switched.
 *
 * The plugin therefore stores no credential of its own. There is no vault, no token scraped off a
 * terminal, nothing sealed and nothing for the panel to leak: each account is an ordinary
 * `claude auth login` that the CLI itself files, refreshes and reads, in whatever way it does that on
 * this platform. What the plugin keeps is a label and the name of a drawer.
 *
 * Two things about that variable are worth knowing before touching this file:
 *
 *  - **It is undocumented.** It is not in `claude --help`; it was found by reading the shipped binary
 *    and confirmed live. Anthropic may rename it. That is why nothing here trusts it: [CodexAccounts]
 *    proves on this machine that it moves the credential and does NOT move the folder, and refuses the
 *    whole feature when it cannot prove both halves.
 *  - **An empty value is not "no isolation", it is the person's real account.** The CLI reads the
 *    variable as "set to empty means the default drawer", so a blank value silently runs the turn on
 *    whoever owns the ordinary sign-in. That is the one outcome this feature must never produce, and
 *    it is why [environmentFor] refuses a blank or relative path instead of quietly dropping it.
 *
 * Everything here is arithmetic over maps and strings, with no platform behind it, so
 * `AccountStoreTest` can hold it without an IDE - which matters because every mistake in it is silent:
 * a turn that runs, answers, and is billed to the wrong subscription.

     * fetched in `~/.claude.json`, stamped with the account named by that same shared file - so the cache
     * reads as "mine" to a process of ANY account, and whenever a fetch does not come back the CLI

     * drawers belonging to three different subscriptions answered with one and the same weekly figure.
     * With a config directory of its own there is nothing to borrow, so the answer is either this
     * account's or an honest blank.

     * Only for asking. A conversation must never run this way: the config directory also carries

     * it has just used, and a directory nobody else writes to is the only place that answer is not
     * somebody else's.

     * The empty drawer for the default sign-in is deliberate and is the one case where an empty value is
     * right: with a config directory of our own, "not set" would send the CLI looking for the credential
     * inside that directory, where there is none. Empty means the drawer the CLI has always used - which
     * is precisely whose figures this row wants. Wrong, it costs nothing worse than a blank: the process
