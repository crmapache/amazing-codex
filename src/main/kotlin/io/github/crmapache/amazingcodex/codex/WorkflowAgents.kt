/**
 * What one agent of a workflow actually did.
 *
 * A `Workflow` call is a single task with a fleet behind it - nine agents, forty - and those agents reach
 * the panel by no route at all: not one of their events carries the mark of a subagent, so there is
 * nothing to switch to and no log to follow. The one thing that does arrive is the run's report, and it
 * carries 400 characters of each agent's errand and 400 of its answer (measured on recorded runs: the CLI
 * cuts both to exactly that). For an agent sent to find bugs in the billing code those 400 characters are
 * the opening brace of its JSON - which is the whole reason this exists.
 *
 * The CLI does keep their conversations, only in files of its own rather than in the stream:
 * `<conversation>/subagents/workflows/<runId>/agent-<agentId>.jsonl`, one per agent, in the ordinary
 * transcript shape. That is what is read here, when a line in the card is unfolded and never before.
 *
 * The run's identifier is not asked for: the report does not carry one, and the agent's own is unique
 * anyway - so the file is looked for by name under the conversation. Reading is done off the event
 * thread, like everything else that touches the disk (see ProjectCatalog).
