/**
 * The subscription's usage as the whole IDE knows it: one picture per account, and every open project
 * shown the same one.
 *
 * The usage belongs to an account, while everything that asks about it belongs to a project - each open
 * project runs its own rounds (see ProjectUsage). It used to keep what it learned to itself as well, and
 * that is how a panel's rings froze for the better part of an hour while the account was being spent
 * before a person's eyes. The server may only be asked about an account so often, so the right to ask is
 * shared across the IDE (see UsageProbes.claim) and granted to whichever project asks first; the others
 * skip their round. Every project's round comes every thirty seconds at its own fixed phase, and a
 * project with a conversation at work asks at every one of them - so the same project won every time,
 * and the one whose round fell a few seconds after it never asked at all. Its rings stayed on the figure
 * it had learned when it opened, 5% on a window that was at 49%, and the only answers that moved went to
 * another project's panel. Simulated: three open projects, one of them working - in almost half of all
 * phase arrangements one project heard nothing for forty minutes.
 *
 * So the answer goes where the question was about, not where it was asked from: whoever asks, the
 * figures are folded into this account's one memory, and the result goes to every open project - its
 * panels and the phones watching it. A project that lost the right to ask loses nothing now.
 *
 * Extra usage is kept here for the same reason: whether money is being spent past the plan is a fact
 * about the account, and one project's stream saying so while another's answer to `get_usage` carried
 * "not spending" would have two panels disagreeing about one subscription.
