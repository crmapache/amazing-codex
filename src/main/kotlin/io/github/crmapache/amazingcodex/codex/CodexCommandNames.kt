/**
 * The names of the slash commands the agent itself knows - read out of the `system:init` event it sends
 * when a conversation's process comes up.
 *
 * This is the only place they can be learned from. The commands that live in files on disk the panel
 * finds by itself (see CodexCommandHints), but the MCP servers' ones - `/mcp__server__prompt` - exist
 * nowhere on disk: the CLI asks every connected server for its prompts and puts the answers into this
 * list. Neither `claude mcp list` nor the conversation's own transcript carries them (checked directly:
 * the transcript holds no init event at all), so a list once heard is worth remembering - see
 * ProjectCatalog.noteCommands.
