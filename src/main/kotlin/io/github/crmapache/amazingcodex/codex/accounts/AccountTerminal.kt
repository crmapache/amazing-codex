/**
 * A terminal of this project, opened with a credential drawer of our choosing.
 *
 * Two things in the panel need one and need it for the same reason: signing in to another account
 * ([AccountSignIn]) and signing in with `codex login` (see CodexLogin). Both are a full dialogue with a
 * process - a browser round trip, a code coming back, an SSO detour - which is why the panel has never
 * had a sign-in form of its own, and both must land in the drawer the panel is actually working on
 * rather than in whichever one the CLI would have opened by itself.
 *
 * **The environment is typed, never a shell prefix.** Writing `VAR=... claude …` into the shell would
 * mean guessing which shell it is - three quoting dialects - and a wrong guess runs the sign-in against
 * the DEFAULT drawer, that is, against the account the person is working on. The platform hands a typed
 * map straight to the process; the shell never sees it as text.

     * A terminal whose process is handed [variables] as a map, with [command] already typed into it.
     *
     * `LocalTerminalDirectRunner` rather than `createShellWidget`, for one reason: the latter takes no
     * environment. The platform merges the map into the process environment after the parent's and
     * before its own `TERM`, so nothing here has to reach into the shell.
     *
     * **The window comes from the platform, not from the terminal manager.** The manager's own
     * `toolWindow` is a raw field, filled only when the window has actually BUILT its contents - that is,
     * when somebody opened the terminal at least once in this IDE session. Asked before that, it answers
     * null, and a person who had not touched the terminal today was told the terminal would not open. It
     * is not even needed to open one: `newTab` ignores the window it is handed except for a null check
     * and finds its own (`getOrInitToolWindow` inside the manager, which is what `createShellWidget` uses
     * as well). The window is asked for here only to bring it to the front afterwards.
     *
     * Called on the interface thread, and answers whether there is a terminal to have looked at.
