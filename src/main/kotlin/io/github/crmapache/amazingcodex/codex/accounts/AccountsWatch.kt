/**
 * Noticing that the account was switched in ANOTHER IDE on this machine.
 *
 * The register is one book for the whole machine now (see [AccountsState]), but a running IDE holds it in
 * memory: without something watching, WebStorm would go on working on the account IntelliJ has just left
 * until somebody restarted it. So the file is watched, and what it says is applied here exactly as a
 * local choice is applied - every conversation in every open project moves onto it.
 *
 * **It must never write anything back.** That is the whole rule of this file. The way in is the same one
 * the local choice uses MINUS its first line: AccountDesk.use sets the current account and then moves
 * everything; this moves everything and sets nothing. Writing back would be, at best, a storm of two IDEs
 * answering each other, and at worst one of them putting its own stale idea of "current" over the choice
 * the person made a second ago, with nothing on screen saying so.
 *
 * The poll is deliberately dull: a file's stamp is one `stat`, and this file changes a few times a day.
 * Only a changed stamp costs a read (see AccountsState.reload).
