/**
 * One conversation's recent messages to the interface, kept so that a client joining later can be
 * given what it missed.
 *
 * Until now nothing at all was kept on this side: an agent's event travelled up to the browser and was
 * forgotten (see CodexPanel.forwardAgentEvent). That was enough while the browser was the only client
 * and died together with the conversation. It stops being enough the moment the panel may be closed
 * over a running turn, and stops being possible at all once a second client - a phone - may join in
 * the middle of one.
 *
 * What is kept is the ready messages themselves, as strings, exactly as they went out. Then "hand the
 * journal over" is literally "send these strings", and the interface needs no second way of reading
 * them: whatever it did with a message the first time it will do again. A parallel format of our own
 * would have to be built by one side and understood by the other, and the two would drift.
 *
 * Every entry carries a number. The numbers are what a client comes back with after a break ("I have
 * everything up to N") and what it gets only the tail by - without them a phone in a lift would
 * reload the whole feed on every reconnect.
