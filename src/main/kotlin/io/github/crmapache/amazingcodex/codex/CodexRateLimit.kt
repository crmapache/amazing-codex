/**
 * The subscription limit's signal out of the agent's stream - the `rate_limit_event` the CLI sends
 * whenever the limit picture changes.
 *
 * Its own "rejected" says far less than it looks, and taking it for "the work has stopped" is exactly
 * the mistake this object exists to prevent. A used-up limit is not the same as a halt:
 *
 * - with extra usage the server lets the requests through and bills them on top of the plan, and the
 *   work goes on without a pause (the CLI reads the very flags read below to decide the same);
 * - during the grace period the limit is over but the current step is allowed to finish;
 * - a signal whose reset time has already passed is about a window that no longer exists - the CLI
 *   throws such a one away, and so do we.
 *
 * Only what is left after all three is a genuine stop.
 *
 * Two places ask about this, for two different reasons: the usage rings need to know that the work is
 * being paid for past the plan (see ProjectUsage), and a phone needs to know that everything has
 * stopped (see NotificationReasons). Both read one verdict here rather than each its own set of rules.
 * The feed decides the same over the same event on its own side - it has words to say about it, not
 * just a flag (see rate_limit_event in feed/build.ts).
