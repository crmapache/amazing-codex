/**
 * The accounts screen, from the plugin's side: the list it draws and the things it can ask for.
 *
 * One per project hub, because the register itself ([CodexAccounts]) is the machine's and knows
 * nothing about screens, while everything here is about one project: whose directory to probe from,
 * whom to answer.
 *
 * It used to be one per panel, beside VoiceDesk and FeedbackDesk, and the reason written here was that
 * a network client does not physically reach the window's door. That is no longer the rule this screen
 * is under - a paired phone drives it now, and the argument for opening it is in RemoteCommands. The
 * old place was also wrong on its own terms: a hub exists for every project a phone attached to,
 * whether or not a tool window was ever opened in it, so the projects reached from a sofa were exactly
 * the ones with no desk to answer them.
 *
 * Two things are still refused over the wire and stay so: adding an account and authorizing Claude
 * Design both end in a terminal and a browser on THIS machine, which nobody on a sofa can finish.
