/**
 * Cutting one outsized message down before it goes into the journal.
 *
 * A single tool result can weigh megabytes - a file read whole, a build log, a database dump. Left
 * alone, one such entry pushes a hundred ordinary ones out of the journal and the feed comes back from
 * a reconnect as a stump: the huge output survives while everything around it - the request that asked
 * for it, the answer that followed - is gone.
 *
 * So the long text inside is shortened rather than the entry thrown away. What is cut is said out loud
 * in the text itself: a feed that quietly shows two thirds of a file is worse than one that says how
 * much is missing.
 *
 * Only strings are touched, and the JSON's shape is left exactly as it was: the interface parses this
 * by the same route as a live message, and a message trimmed into invalid JSON would take the whole
 * feed down with it rather than one card.
