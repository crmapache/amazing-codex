/**
 * Which tabs a project has, in what order, and which of them came out of which.
 *
 * Until now this list lived only in the browser (see App.tsx): the interface made the identifiers up,
 * kept the order and worked out the grouping, while this side merely received a session id inside every
 * message and never asked where it came from. That works exactly as long as there is one client. A
 * second one - a phone - has no such list and no way to build one: it did not open these tabs and did
 * not see them being opened.
 *
 * So the list moves here, and the identifiers stay with whoever presses the button. That is deliberate:
 * "+" has to answer instantly, and a round trip to this side before a tab appears would be felt. A
 * taken identifier is refused (see [open]) and the client is told the real list - which is cheaper than
 * making everyone wait for the rare case of two clients pressing "+" in the same millisecond.
