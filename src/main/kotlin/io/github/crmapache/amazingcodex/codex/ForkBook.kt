/**
 * Which of this project's conversations are forks, and of what - by the fork's own conversation id.
 *
 * The CLI does not say. A fork's transcript holds what it inherited under the same uuids its source has, and
 * nothing in it marks where the fork's own part begins or which conversation the rest came from (checked on
 * 2.1.280). The panel knows both at the moment the fork is born, and this is where it puts them down: the
 * seam in the feed has to stand in its place long after the tab that made the fork is gone - after a restart,
 * in a conversation opened from the history, on a phone - and a fork of a compacted conversation has to reach
 * back into its source for what its own transcript was never given (see ForkLineage).
 *
 * One small file per project, machine-wide rather than per IDE, beside the scenarios' books and by their rules
 * (see ScenarioFile): two IDEs open on one project read the same transcripts and owe them the same answer.
