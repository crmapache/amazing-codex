/**
 * The messages waiting for the turn in progress to end, by conversation.
 *
 * Here rather than in the window that typed them, and that is the whole point of the class. A queue used
 * to be a piece of state inside a screen: the panel's own, and a second copy of it on the phone. At a
 * desk that mostly works - the panel stays open beside the IDE. On a phone it does not: the page is
 * thrown out while it sits in someone's pocket, the socket closes with the screen, and putting the phone
 * away is exactly what one queues a message in order to do. What happened instead was that the message
 * disappeared - not sent, not queued, nowhere - and the person came back to a conversation that had
 * simply stopped after the last turn.
 *
 * Kept beside the conversation, it survives all of that, and both windows see the same list: a message
 * queued at the desk is visible from the sofa, and either screen can take it out again.
 *
 * What is not kept here is the numbering of the images, the chips, or anything else about how the
 * message will be drawn - that travels in [Entry.echo] untouched and unread, exactly as an ordinary
 * message's echo does (see CodexSessionHub.prompt).
