     * [NOTHING] believes anything, and a description is not a name.

     * [refusals] is the other half. The guard is meant as a hiccup's worth of patience: the share
     * stuttered, we waited, it came back. But a directory can also close for good - macOS revoking
     * access to Documents, a plugin folder losing its mode, a volume that answers with a refusal from
     * now on - and then the guard fires on every single round for ever: the hint freezes on what was
     * read before the loss, a new skill never reaches it again, and no fingerprint is written either,
     * so the two-second round re-reads every file on disk until the IDE is restarted. So patience is
     * finite: after [PATIENCE] rounds in a row the loss is accepted as the truth, what was read is sent,
     * and the fingerprint is written. A hiccup is still ridden out in silence; a closed door stops being
     * a life sentence.

     * How long the fast round waits before walking the disk again.
     *
     * Two seconds is what a local disk is worth. Everything else this has to survive is a disk that is
     * not local: a 9P share, an SMB mount, an external drive spinning up, an antivirus. There a walk
     * costs seconds rather than milliseconds, and a fixed two-second round would keep one thread
     * permanently busy and keep the drive from ever going back to sleep - so the round pays back its own
     * cost fifty times over before it starts again.
     *
     * Four details, each of them a way to get this wrong:
     *
     * - the ceiling is the slow round. Above that the fast round buys nothing that the unconditional
     *   minute does not already buy, and a hint that answers slower than it did before the change would
     *   be a plain regression on exactly the machines that can least afford one.
     * - going back to quick takes a run of quick walks rather than one. A single spin-up or a swapped
     *   page would otherwise push the next look a hundred seconds out while the disk was already awake,
     *   with nothing on screen to say why.
     * - "quick" is measured against the round in force, not against a fixed number of milliseconds. On
     *   a share, a WSL mount or a disk behind an antivirus a walk costs a hundred milliseconds every
     *   time, so against an absolute figure no walk there is ever quick and the period could only ever
     *   go up: one spin-up pinned it at the ceiling until the IDE was restarted. Relative, the brake
     *   lets go again on any machine - it settles at what that machine's walk is actually worth.
     * - the clock is [System.nanoTime]. Wall time steps backwards - NTP after a long sleep, a restored
     *   snapshot - and a deadline written in it freezes the round for the length of the step. Which is
     *   also why "not looked yet" is [nextAt] absent rather than [nextAt] zero: nanoTime is allowed to
     *   start at any number at all, negative included, and on a machine whose clock starts below zero a
     *   deadline of zero sits years in the future - the fast round would never run once, silently.
