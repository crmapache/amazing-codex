/**
 * The limit windows a person has already been called about, for the whole IDE rather than for one
 * project.
 *
 * The plan's limit belongs to an account and the thing that notices it running out belongs to a project:
 * every open project reads its own agent's stream and sees the same crossing for itself (see
 * ProjectUsage.noteRateLimit). Three projects with agents working meant three identical pushes to a phone
 * about one moment - and that moment is the one occasion a person away from the desk is called about
 * something no message mentions, so the repeat is all there is to read.
 *
 * So the announcement is claimed once per window: the first project to see the crossing takes it, and
 * whoever comes after finds it taken. Held in memory rather than on disk - this is about not saying one
 * thing twice, and after a restart there is nothing left to repeat.
