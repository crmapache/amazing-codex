/**
 * The limit windows a person has already been called about, for the whole IDE rather than for one
 * project.
 *
 * The plan's limit belongs to an account and the thing that notices it running out belongs to a project:
 * every open project reads its own agent's stream and sees the same crossing for itself. Three projects
 * with agents working meant three identical pushes to a phone about one moment - and that moment is the
 * one occasion a person away from the desk is called about something no message mentions, so the repeat
 * is all there is to read. The state the crossing is a change of is the account's now (see
 * AccountUsage.noteRateLimit), which takes most repeats away on its own; this still holds the ones it
 * cannot see - two processes on one account whose events disagree for a moment around the crossing
 * read as off, on, off, on, and each "on" is a crossing of that one window.
 *
 * So the announcement is claimed once per window: the first project to see the crossing takes it, and
 * whoever comes after finds it taken. Held in memory rather than on disk - this is about not saying one
 * thing twice, and after a restart there is nothing left to repeat.
