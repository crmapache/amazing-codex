/**
 * Where Claude Code lives for a project: the directory it keeps its settings and conversations in, the
 * directory an organization's policy sits in, and the project's path as the CLI itself names it.
 *
 * All of that used to be taken from the machine the IDE runs on - `user.home`, the IDE's own
 * environment, the project's path as the IDE spells it - and that holds exactly as long as the CLI runs
 * on that same machine and sees the same paths. It stops holding the moment a project is opened out of
 * WSL: the IDE stays on Windows and spells the project `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\ivan\repo`, while the
 * CLI is started inside the distribution, sees `/home/ivan/repo`, and files the conversation under
 * `/home/ivan/.claude/projects/-home-ivan-repo`. The panel meanwhile looked into
 * `C:\Users\Ivan\.claude\projects\--wsl-localhost-Ubuntu-home-ivan-repo` - the wrong machine and the
 * wrong name at once - found nothing, and showed an empty history without a word: a folder that is not
 * there is the ordinary state of a machine with no conversations yet, so nothing was logged. The same
 * assumption sat behind the user's settings layer, the personal commands in the slash hint, today's
 * token count and the search index, and every one of them was quietly empty or wrong there too.
 *
 * So the question "where does the CLI keep its things" is asked of the project rather than of the JVM,
 * and answered once here for every reader of that disk. For a project on this machine nothing changes:
 * [local] is the answer the readers computed for themselves before. For a project inside WSL the answer
 * is the distribution's user home, its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, its `/etc/claude-code`, and the Linux
 * path of the project - all reachable from Windows through the same share the project is opened from,
 * so the readers themselves (listing files, reading lines, asking for dates) do not change at all.
 *
 * The WSL half is asked only on Windows and only for a path that looks like a share (`//` or `\\`):
 * everything else takes the local road without touching a single WSL class. Learning the distribution's
 * user home costs a `wsl.exe` process the first time (the platform keeps the answer afterwards), so it
 * is [warmUp]-ed when the project opens, off every thread anybody waits on, and never asked from the
 * event dispatch thread - the platform answers nothing there rather than block it (see
 * WslDistributionSafeNullableLazyValue), and nothing is the one answer this resolver cannot build on:
 * then it falls back to the local reading, says so in the diagnostics, and tries again later.
