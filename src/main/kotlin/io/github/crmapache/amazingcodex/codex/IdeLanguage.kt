 * promise is only worth anything if this reads the same thing the IDE's own menus read.
 *
 * [DynamicBundle.getLocale] is that thing: it is the locale a JetBrains language pack installs, which is
 * what actually changes the IDE's own words. The operating system's locale is only a fallback, and a
 * distant second on purpose - a Russian Windows running an English IDE is a person who chose English.
