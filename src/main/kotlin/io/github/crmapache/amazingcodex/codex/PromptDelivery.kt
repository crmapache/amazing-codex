/**
 * Whether a person's message reached the conversation itself.
 *
 * Needed because a message written into a running turn goes missing at the CLI: it travels into its
 * input stream, the CLI takes it, and after that it is luck. When the agent is printing an answer at
 * that moment, the CLI defers the message and starts a new turn with it; when it is busy with a tool,
 * the message often disappears entirely. No refusal, no event in the stream: to all appearances the
 * person wrote something and the agent simply says nothing.
 *
 * In the event stream an accepted message leaves no trace - the CLI does not echo it. In the
 * conversation's file it does: what it accepted it always writes there, and one of two kinds of record
 * shows exactly how it got there.
 *
 * - `type: user` - the message became a new turn;
 * - `type: attachment` with `queued_command` - it went to the running turn, and the agent saw it at its
 *   next step.
 *
 * Which of the two it was matters: an ordinary message is delivered either way, while a slash command
 * absorbed into a running turn carried out nothing at all - see [verdict] and
 * CodexSession.checkDeliveries.

     * "/compact" as a remark made mid-work, and the agent - quite rightly - does nothing with it. An
     * ordinary message in that same place is delivered properly: the agent is asked to take it up as it

     * all. So silence about a command is not evidence of anything, and a repeat on a guess is a second
