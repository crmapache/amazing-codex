/**
 * The machine's Claude accounts: which ones there are, which one new conversations start on, and the
 * environment a process must be given to run as one of them.
 *
 * Application-level on purpose. Three open projects each run their own sign-in poller and their own
 * usage figures, but the set of accounts is a fact about the machine and the credentials are shared by
 * every IDE on it. A per-project register would let two windows disagree about who is signed in.
 *
 * The mechanism itself - one environment variable, per process, moving the credential drawer and
 * nothing else - is explained in [AccountStore]. What lives here is everything that needs a process, a
 * disk or a service, and one rule that runs through all of it:
 *
 * **A named account that cannot be resolved stops the launch.** It never falls back to the ordinary
 * sign-in. Falling back would work, look normal, answer normally, and bill the wrong subscription
 * without a word - which is the one failure this feature cannot be allowed to have. Everything that
 * resolves an account returns a refusal rather than a default.
