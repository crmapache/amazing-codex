 * The description and argument syntax of slash commands - the same thing the terminal's hint shows

 * hands over bare command names only (verified directly: `system:init`.`slash_commands` is a flat list
 * of strings, without description or argument-hint), so we read the same files the CLI itself does: the
 * frontmatter of the project's, the user's and every installed plugin's commands and skills.
 *
 * For the CLI's genuinely built-in commands (code-review, for instance - it is baked into the binary
 * rather than a file) there is no file on disk and never will be: their syntax is hardcoded in
 * catalog.ts (BUILTIN_COMMANDS), checked against the binary directly.
 *
 * What is found here is not only the descriptions but the names themselves - until the first message of
 * a conversation has been sent the agent has named nothing, and this scan is the only thing the hint has
 * (see buildCommands in feed/slash.ts). That is why a file without a description is kept rather than
 * dropped: its name is the greater half of what the hint is for.
 *
 * The walk is split in two on purpose - candidates first, their frontmatter only if asked. A skill
 * written while a conversation is running has to reach the hint in seconds rather than in a minute (the
 * CLI itself picks it up in 1.6-4.2 s, measured), and a round that often must cost a stat rather than a
 * read of every file: see [scanIfChanged] and ProjectCatalog's fast round.
 *
 * Where the CLI keeps its personal files is asked of the CALLER rather than resolved here. Two reasons,
 * and both bite: a home computed once and kept is a WSL project reading this machine's `.claude` for
 * ever (see CodexHome - off a pooled thread the platform answers with the local home), and a scan that
 * resolves it itself cannot be tested at all, because every test would mix in the real `~/.claude` of
 * whoever runs it.
