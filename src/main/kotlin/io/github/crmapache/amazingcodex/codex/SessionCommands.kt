/**
 * The one door a request from a client goes through.
 *
 * Until now this was a `when` inside the panel over forty-odd kinds of message, and while the browser
 * was the only client that was fine: whatever could reach it was already inside the IDE. It stops
 * being fine the moment a second client may sit on a phone across the city, because the difference
 * between "read the feed" and "run a shell command" then becomes the difference between watching and
 * remote code execution.
 *
 * So execution moves out of the panel and behind a single entrance. The panel calls it directly - it
 * is the IDE, and what it may do the person at the keyboard may do. Anything arriving over a network
 * will be filtered before it gets here (phase 2), and having one entrance is what makes that filter
 * possible to write at all: a second path around it would be a hole nobody would notice.
 *
 * What stays with the panel is what only an IDE window can do: the file chooser, the clipboard, the
 * cursor, the sounds, the dock. Those are not commands about a conversation, and a phone has no
 * business asking for them.
