/**
 * Signing in happens in the IDE's built-in terminal.
 *
 * The panel cannot have a sign-in screen of its own: `claude auth login` opens a browser and waits for
 * a code to come back, that is, it is a full dialogue with a process. The IDE's terminal already exists
 * for that - no reason to build a second one.
 *
 * **And it goes into the drawer the panel is actually on.** This used to open a plain shell, which is
 * the CLI's DEFAULT drawer - while the sign-in screen in front of it asks about the current account
 * (see ProjectAuth.check). With an added account in force those are two different drawers, so an
 * expired token turned into a dead end that looked like a broken button: the person signed in
 * correctly, the browser said "you are all set up", and the panel went on offering to open the terminal
 * again - for ever, because the credential had landed somewhere it was never going to be asked about.
 *
 * So the environment is [AccountTerminal]'s, exactly as when an account is added, and for the same
 * reasons - a typed map rather than a shell prefix, because guessing the quoting dialect wrong is what
 * sends a sign-in into the default drawer, that is, over the account the person is working on.
 *
 * A drawer that will not resolve is a refusal rather than a fallback. The alternative - opening a plain
 * terminal anyway - is the very bug above: a sign-in that goes somewhere nobody is looking.
