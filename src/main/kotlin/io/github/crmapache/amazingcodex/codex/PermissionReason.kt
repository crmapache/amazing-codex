/**
 * Why the person is being asked about this call at all - and whether "always allow" is worth offering.
 *
 * Permissions come from more than the mode. Safety checks raise them, so do `ask` rules from the
 * settings, hooks, and the `auto` mode's classifier - and in the modes where no questions are expected
 * at all ("Bypass", "Auto") those are precisely what is left. Without an explanation such a question
 * reads as unaccountable nagging: the person chose "do not ask", and the panel asks anyway.
 *
 * Apart from [PermissionPrompt] because that one captions the call itself ("wants to run a command"),
 * while this is the line about who raised the question.
