/**
 * The accounts this machine knows about and which one everything runs on.
 *
 * **One book for the whole machine, not for one IDE.** It lives in a file beside the credential drawers
 * it maps (`~/.amazing-codex/`), so WebStorm and IntelliJ open the same list and answer the same
 * "which account am I working on" - the shape the statistics already have (see StatsLedger), and for a
 * stronger reason: the drawers are shared whatever this file says, so a per-IDE list meant one IDE
 * holding the only pointer to a credential the other could not see.
 *
 * **Deliberately NOT a PersistentStateComponent any more.** With `@State` still on it the platform would
 * call `loadState` with the IDE's own XML right after this constructor read the shared file, and the
 * register would silently split again with nothing to show for it. RemoteState keeps its own `@State` on
 * the same XML; nothing here touches that.
 *
 * **No secret is here, and there is none anywhere else in the plugin either.** A record holds a label, an
 * address, an organisation and the name of a credential drawer; the credential itself is the CLI's, filed
 * by the CLI in the system's own store. That is a property of the mechanism rather than discipline on our
 * part - see [AccountStore].
 *
 * Reads answer out of memory and never touch the disk: `currentId` is asked on the relay's thread and on
 * the one that carries the panel's messages, and a file read there stalls every conversation on the line.
 * What keeps memory honest is [reload], called by [AccountsWatch] every couple of seconds.
