/**
 * Which messages a conversation has already taken, by the identifier their sender gave them.

 * A phone cannot know whether a message it sent arrived: the road goes through a relay and a mobile
 * network, and a frame lost on the way is lost without a word. So a phone keeps what it sent until the IDE
 * says it has it, and sends it again when the line comes back or the person presses Retry (see
 * mobile/outbox.ts). That is only safe if a second copy of a message that did arrive is not said a second
 * time - a repeated "delete the branch" is not something to find out about afterwards. This is that
 * promise: the first copy is taken, every later one is recognised and dropped, and the sender is told it
 * has arrived either way.
 *
 * Kept per conversation and only for the last [kept] messages of each. A repeat comes within a minute or
 * two of the original - a reconnect, a press of Retry - not after a hundred other messages.
