/**
 * The answer being printed right now - the part of it that has arrived so far.
 *
 * The deltas it is made of are the one thing that does not go into the journal. They arrive dozens a
 * second, and every one of them is superseded a moment later by the finished block that carries the
 * same words whole: keeping them would spend the journal's whole budget on text that is about to be
 * repeated.
 *
 * But a client joining in the middle of a turn cannot be shown nothing either - the conversation would
 * look frozen for as long as the answer takes. So the deltas are folded up here as they pass, and a
 * new client is handed the fold in one piece and then carries on from the live ones.
 *
 * The rules for what counts are the interface's rules (see the stream_event case in feed/build.ts), and
 * they have to stay the same rules: a fold assembled differently from the feed it joins would show a
 * paragraph twice or lose one.
