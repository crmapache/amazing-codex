/**
 * Whether two rows on the accounts screen are one account wearing two drawers - and whether a row is the
 * account it is filed under at all.
 *
 * Two drawers on one account happen without anybody's mistake: the sign-in Codex already had is a
 * row like any other, and nothing stops the person signing a SECOND drawer into that same account - by
 * adding it here, or by signing the CLI's own drawer back in later, as the very account this screen
 * already lists. Two added rows can end up the same way, once a mislabelled one is filed under its true
 * name (see [mislabelled]). The screen then shows one subscription twice, with two sets of figures that say
 * almost the same thing because they ARE the same thing, and the account a conversation is billed to
 * depends on which of the two identical rows was pressed.
 *
 * And it costs more than the screen: two rows of one account split its conversations between two
 * credentials, so a sign-in renewed in one of them leaves the other running on the old one.
 *
 * **Identity, not address.** Accounts are compared by [AccountStore.keyOf], which takes the organisation
 * as well as the address. Comparing addresses alone would merge two seats of one person in two different
 * organisations, which are two subscriptions and two bills.
 *
 * **Only an answer fetched after we asked.** A drawer's usage config keeps the profile it fetched for up to
 * a day, so a drawer signed into by somebody else since still names whoever used to be in it. Acting on
 * that would delete a live drawer because of who USED to be in another one, and the credential in it is
 * the only copy on this machine. So the answer has to have been fetched after the question went out - by
 * when the CLI fetched it, not by when it last rewrote the file (see AccountIdentity.probe); anything
 * older is treated as no answer at all, and the rows simply stay as they are until a fresh one arrives.
 * Nothing was ever asked ([answeredAfter] of zero) is the same answer.
 *
 * **And only a drawer that is signed in now.** Belt and braces since the usage question takes a stale
 * profile away before asking (see AccountIdentity.expire): the liveness comes from the caller, who has just
 * asked the drawer itself.
