/**
 * The project's conversations, and everything anyone needs to know about them.
 *
 * Until now this lived inside the panel: [CodexSessions] was created while building the browser and
 * died with the tool window, the feed's state existed only in that browser's memory, and an event that
 * had been forwarded was forgotten on this side. Two things follow from that arrangement, and both are
 * defects rather than choices:
 *
 * - closing the panel over a running turn killed the process along with the whole conversation;
 * - a client that had not been present from the first message had no way to learn what had happened.
 *
 * The second one is what makes a phone impossible, and the first is what makes it pointless. So the
 * conversations move out here, to something whose life is the project's rather than a window's, and
 * the panel becomes one of its clients instead of its owner.
 *
 * Everything a client is sent goes out through one door - see [broadcast]. That is not tidiness: the
 * journal's numbering only means anything if the number a message carries and the order it goes out in
 * are decided in the same place. Twelve senders taking their own numbers would arrive in one order and
 * be numbered in another, and the tail handed out after a reconnect would come with holes in it.

     *   them, and it would fire the moment the turn is over - into a conversation that no longer holds what
     *   it answers. The dialog says so before the press. What is queued while the rewind is on its way was
     *   written after the cut, and stays.
     * - **The questions the stopped turn was asking are withdrawn**: the turn that asked them is gone.
     * - **The files the code part put back are read again** by the IDE, the way an agent's own edits are
     *   (see DiskRefresh): an editor showing the text that was just taken away is the one thing worse
     *   than the rewind not happening. What is unsaved in an editor is saved first, as before any turn -
     *   otherwise the restore and the editor fight over the file afterwards.
