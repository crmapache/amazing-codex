/**
 * One run of one scenario, from the head coming up to the last card being judged.
 *
 * The division of labour is the whole design and it is worth saying plainly. The **shape** belongs to
 * this file: which stage is next, how many passes it gets, which card comes after which, and the
 * ceilings that stop a night from spending itself. The **judgement** belongs to the head session:
 * whether what came back is what was asked for, what the next card needs to be told, and what to say to
 * a card that has stopped to ask something. Neither is good at the other's job. A host deciding whether
 * a review was thorough enough would be a second, worse model; a model deciding which stage comes next
 * would make the picture on the screen a suggestion.
 *
 * Written as a state machine rather than as a walk down a blocking thread. A run lasts hours and spends
 * nearly all of them waiting for a process to say something, and a thread parked on that for a night is
 * a thread taken out of the IDE's pool for a night. Everything here is entered from a process's reader
 * thread, so every entrance is synchronized: two answers arriving at once must not both decide what
 * happens next.
