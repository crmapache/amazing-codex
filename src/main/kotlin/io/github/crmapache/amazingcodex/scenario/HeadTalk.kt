/**
 * What is said to the head, and how what comes back is read.
 *
 * The head is a Claude session with no tools of ours: the panel asks it a question and reads its answer,
 * one question at a time. That is a deliberate choice over giving it tools to drive the board with. The
 * shape of the round of work - which stage is next, how many passes, which card follows which - belongs
 * to the engine, and a head able to start a card whenever it liked would be free to skip a stage, to loop
 * on one card, or to decide at four in the morning that the flow was wrong. A board whose picture is not
 * what happens is not a board.
 *
 * Every answer is a sentence for the person followed by a small JSON object for the machine, and both
 * halves earn their place. The object is what the engine acts on. The sentence is the only part of an
 * orchestrator's thinking anybody wants to read in the morning, and the timeline wedges it in between the
 * cards, where it was said.
