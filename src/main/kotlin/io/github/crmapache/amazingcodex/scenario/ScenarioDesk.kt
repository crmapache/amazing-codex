/**
 * One project's scenarios, as the clients see them: the two shelves, the runs that came of them, and
 * however many runs are going right now.
 *
 * There used to be one at a time, refused at the door, and the argument for it was real: two runs in one
 * working copy are four agents editing the same files with nobody to reconcile them, and what that
 * produces is not a message on a screen but a branch with half of one round of work and half of another
 * in it. It was asked for anyway, and the reason is the better one: the same round of work against three
 * different tickets is three runs of one scenario, and told to take them in turn a person simply waits.
 * So the door is open, and the cost is paid where it can be seen - each run says which one it is (see
 * [markOf]), the hub lists them while they go, and the CLOCK still refuses to raise a second run from the
 * same standing arrangement, because nobody chose that moment.
 *
 * Everything that touches the disk runs off the thread the request came in on, like the rest of the
 * plugin's readers: a shelf may be on a network drive, and the thread a message arrives on is the one
 * every other conversation's messages arrive on too.
