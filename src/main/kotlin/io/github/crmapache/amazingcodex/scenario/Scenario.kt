/**
 * A scenario: the round of work somebody repeats, written down once so the panel can walk it.
 *
 * The shape is a flow read top to bottom. A stage is a step of the round and exists for one reason - it
 * is the thing that can be sent round again. A card is one thing said to one conversation of its own,
 * and the cards of a stage happen one after another, so a card may be written in the knowledge that the
 * one above it has already finished.
 *
 * Two readers, and which one a field is addressed to is the whole of understanding this file. [Card.prompt]
 * is said to the card's own session and is the work. [Card.dod] and [Card.after] are read by the head:
 * they are how it knows the card is finished and what to carry forward. Mixing the two is how a scenario
 * ends up asking an agent to satisfy a definition of done it was never shown.
