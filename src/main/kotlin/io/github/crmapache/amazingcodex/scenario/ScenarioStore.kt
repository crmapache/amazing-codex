/**
 * Where the scenarios live, on two shelves.

 * The same split Claude Code itself makes, and for the same reason: a round of work the team repeats
 * belongs to the repository, beside the project's own commands and skills, where it is reviewed and
 * shared; a round of work one person repeats belongs to that person's Claude home, where it follows them
 * from project to project. Anything else would mean inventing a third place for something the CLI has
 * already taught everybody to look for in two.
 *
 * Read from disk on every request rather than cached. They are a handful of small files, the panel asks
 * for them when a tab is opened, and a cache would have to be kept honest against an editor window, a
 * git checkout and a second IDE - three writers this side does not own.
