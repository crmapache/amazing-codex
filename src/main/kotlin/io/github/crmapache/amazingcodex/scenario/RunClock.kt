/**
 * The run's own clock: how long it has genuinely worked, as opposed to how long it has existed.
 *
 * A run is a night, and a night has stretches in which nothing is done: a pause somebody pressed, a question
 * standing until a person wakes up to answer it, an IDE that went away and was opened again in the morning.
 * A clock that counts them says a run "took nine hours" that worked for two, and the table of past runs is
 * read to compare nights - a comparison that only works if the figure is the work.
 *
 * Three things are kept apart, and each is subtracted from the span between start and end:
 * - [ScenarioRun.idle] - between an ending and the moment the run was picked up again (ScenarioEngine.carryOn);
 * - [ScenarioRun.rested] - standing still while it was a run (this file);
 * - the time after an IDE went away - not counted at all, because the run is closed where it was last
 *   written rather than where it was found (RunStore.abandoned).
 *
 * The screens add up the same thing out of the same fields (runWorked in timeline.ts).
