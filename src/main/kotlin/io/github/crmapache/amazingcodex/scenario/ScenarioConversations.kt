/**
 * The conversations this project raised for scenario runs rather than for the person.
 *
 * A run is made of ordinary CLI conversations - one for the main thread and one for every card it hands
 * out - and the CLI keeps them where it keeps everybody's, in the project's own folder of transcripts.
 * Which is right: the log of a card is read from there, and a copy of our own could only go stale (see
 * RunStore). The price shows up on the one screen that lists that folder: a night of work puts a dozen
 * conversations nobody held into the list of past conversations, and the person's own three from that
 * evening are somewhere underneath them. That list answers "what was I doing", and a machine's night is
 * not an answer to it.
 *
 * So the identifiers are written down as they are learned, and the history skips them (see
 * CodexHistory.list). Written down rather than recognised in the transcript: the main thread's first
 * message is ours and could be spotted, but a card's first message is the prompt somebody wrote in their
 * own scenario, and there is nothing in it to tell it from a question typed by hand.
 *
 * One small file per project, beside the queue and the scheduled hours and by their rules - kept on this
 * machine, keyed by a hash of the path, locked across IDE windows (see ScenarioFile).
