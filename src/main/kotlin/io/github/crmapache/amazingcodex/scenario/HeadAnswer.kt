/**
 * Reading the object the head answered with - a model's JSON, and therefore any shape at all.
 *
 * The head is asked for a small object with named fields (see HeadTalk), and it usually writes one. What
 * it is not is a promise: asked for a sentence in `handoff` it may answer with an object of notes, asked
 * for `reason` it may answer with a list. Read with kotlinx's `jsonPrimitive`, every one of those throws
 * - and the throw lands on the thread reading the CLI's output, so what a person sees is not a run that
 * went wrong but the IDE's own "Exception in plugin" dialog, with the run standing still behind it.
 *
 * Recorded live: a head on Haiku answered `handoff` with an object, and this is what came of it.
 *
 * So every field is read as "a primitive, or nothing" - the same forgiving reading the model's own
 * scenarios are put through (see ScenarioAuthor.scenarioOf). A field of the wrong shape is then a field
 * nobody said, which is a thing the engine already knows how to handle: it asks again, once, and gives
 * up with a verdict rather than an exception.
