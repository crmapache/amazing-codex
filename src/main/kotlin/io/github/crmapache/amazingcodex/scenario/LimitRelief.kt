/**
 * Where a scenario run goes on when the account it works on is refused by its own limit - and, when no
 * account has room, until when it waits.
 *
 * A run is work nobody is watching. Before this, a five-hour window running out at night was the end of
 * it: the card's turn died with "you've hit your session limit", the head was asked to judge that, was
 * refused the same way, and the run was written off as a head that never decided - with two more accounts
 * on the machine sitting idle. In the morning the person picked another account and pressed Continue.
 * That is exactly what is done here, at the moment it went wrong.
 *
 * Only the run moves. The person's own choice of account (CodexAccounts.currentId) is theirs, and so are
 * the tabs on it: a model's week running out is a refusal of that model only, and moving every tab off an
 * account its other models still serve would interrupt work nothing had stopped. A run that borrowed an
 * account goes back to following the person's choice the moment they make one (see ScenarioEngine.follow).
