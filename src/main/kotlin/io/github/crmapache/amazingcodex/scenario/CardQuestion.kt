 * What a card stopped to ask, and how an answer is written back to it.

 * Two different things arrive down the same channel and they are answered differently. A permission is a
 * yes or a no with a sentence attached. A question with options is not a permission at all: the CLI
 * expects the chosen option back in the call's own arguments and builds the tool result out of it itself,
 * so refusing one - which is what "no" means everywhere else - tells the card nobody answered.
