/**
 * The fence around what the head may do, as code rather than as a sentence in a prompt.
 *
 * The head is a foreman: it reads the project to check what a card claims, and everything that writes to
 * the disk belongs to a card. Told that in words alone it would hold until four in the morning, when the
 * quickest way to finish a definition of done is to write the file itself - and `echo x > file` is a
 * write, and so are `sed -i`, `git commit` and `rm`.
 *
 * A list of allowed first words rather than a list of forbidden ones. A forbidden list is a guess about
 * every way a shell can write to a disk, and a shell always has one more. Each link of a chain is judged
 * on its own, because `ls && rm -rf .` begins with an allowed word.
 *
 * An allowed first word is not the end of it, and the reason is worth writing down: a program that reads
 * is not the same as a program that only reads. Three kinds of hole had to be closed by hand and are the
 * three lists below. A program whose whole purpose is to write (`tee`) or to run something the fence
 * cannot see (`xargs`) is not on the list at all. A program that writes when a particular flag is given
 * (`sed -i`, `find -delete`, `curl -o`) is judged on its flags wherever in the command they stand, not on
 * its second word. And an interpreter is here to run the project's own checks, so the two ways of handing
 * it a program of one's own - a flag with the code in it, and no program at all, which means the code is
 * coming down the pipe - are refused.
 *
 * None of this makes the fence complete, and it is not pretending to: the list is a list, and a shell
 * always has one more way. It makes the fence mean roughly what is written on it, which a list that lets
 * `node -e` through does not.
