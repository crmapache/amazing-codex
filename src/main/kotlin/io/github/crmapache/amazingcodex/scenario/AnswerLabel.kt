/**
 * What a run's first answer is called beside its scenario's name - here, in the notifications a run
 * sends while the panel is closed (see ScenarioDesk.markOf). The panel and the phone name their marks by
 * the same rule (answerLabel in webview/src/scenarios/runs.ts), and the two have to agree: the notification
 * and the row it leads to must call the run the same thing.
 *
 * The first line of the first answer given, cut to a label's length - an answer is free text and can be a
 * paragraph. And for a link, the part of it that names something. A pasted link is the commonest answer
 * there is - the ticket, the Notion page, the pull request - and its head is the same for every run:
 * "https://app.notion.com/p/" comes before anything that tells one page from another, so a label cut from
 * its start named two runs against two pages the same. A link is named by its last path segment instead,
 * and a bare number by the segment before it as well ("pull/45", "issues/123"). A link with no path is its
 * host.
