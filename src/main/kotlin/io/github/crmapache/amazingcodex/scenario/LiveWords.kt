/**
 * What a card is saying right now - the row's live line (`RunStep.said`), read off its stream as it is
 * written.
 *
 * Three things were wrong with the plain sum of the text deltas it used to be, all seen on one roas-radar
 * run at once.
 *
 * - **A block of text is a paragraph of its own.** The agent says a sentence, runs a tool, says the next
 *   one, and every one of those is a text block of a message of its own. Added up with nothing between
 *   them they read "Reading the migration.Writing the red tests", and two bold lines in a row became
 *   `**Context.****Finding 1**` - markup the screen can no longer make out. A new block starts after an
 *   empty line, so the screen parses it as the paragraph it is (see Glance in the webview).
 * - **Only the card's own words.** A card that launches reviewers in parallel gets their deltas on the same
 *   stream, a piece of each in turn, and a sum of those is no one's sentence. A subagent's events carry
 *   the call that spawned it, and they are left out by the same mark the feed and TurnEndings use.
 * - **The newest words are the ones kept.** The cap used to keep the first few hundred characters, so the
 *   line stopped moving after the first minute or two of a card's work and showed the same stale sentence
 *   for the remaining hour - the very "stuck or working?" question it exists to answer. Now the oldest
 *   words go, and the cut lands where a paragraph, a line or at least a word begins, so what is left
 *   still parses as markdown: a cut through `**bold**` puts a pair of bare asterisks on the screen.
 *
 * The same text is what the head is shown as "what it was saying when it stopped" when it takes a card
 * over (see HeadTalk.takeOverRequest), and there too the last words are the ones that matter.
