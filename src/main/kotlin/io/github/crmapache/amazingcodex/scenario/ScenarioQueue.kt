/**
 * A round of work set to start once the one before it is out of the way.
 *
 * Runs go side by side - that is what the shelf's Run button means and it is not changing (see
 * ScenarioDesk) - and side by side is exactly what a night of work must not be: three rounds of work
 * editing one working copy is a branch with a third of each of them in it. The queue is the other answer
 * to the same wish. Everything put on it is started ONE AT A TIME, in the order it was put there, and
 * nothing is started while the one before is still going.
 *
 * One queue for the whole project, not one per scenario, because the thing being taken in turns is the
 * working copy and there is one of those. A different project has its own queue and its own turn.
 *
 * A run somebody started by hand, or the clock did, counts as well. Run still means "start now, beside
 * whatever is going" - but that is a sentence about the run being started, not about what the queue does
 * afterwards: when a turn's time comes and a run is going in this working copy, whoever raised it, the
 * queue stands behind that run exactly as it stands behind one of its own (see [ScenarioQueue.runId]).
 * The first version waited only for runs of its own, and the way that showed was the simplest thing a
 * queue is for: one round of work started by hand, the next put on the queue behind it - and started at
 * once, beside it, in the same working copy.
