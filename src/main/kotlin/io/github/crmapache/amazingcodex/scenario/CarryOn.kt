/**
 * Where a finished run is picked up from - see ScenarioEngine.carryOn.
 *
 * A run that was stopped, or fell over, is not the end of the round of work: the main thread's
 * conversation is on the disk and remembers everything it was told, and so is the conversation of the
 * card it was on. What the record does NOT say is which phase the engine was in when it ended - that
 * lived in memory - so it is read back off the steps, and the reading is worth a test because a wrong one
 * either does a card twice or skips one, and both look perfectly healthy on the screen.
 *
 * The rule: the last card that finished is the last thing that certainly happened. After it there is at
 * most one card that had begun - the one cut short - and everything else never had its go. So the run is
 * picked up AT the cut card if there is one, and otherwise right after the last finished one - which is
 * also where a loop is asked "another pass?" again, since that is how the engine steps past a card.
 *
 * "After the last finished card" rather than "the first card that is not done", because of the loop that
 * ended early on purpose: the passes it never needed are skipped rows BEFORE later cards that did run,
 * and counted from the front they would be taken for the place to resume.
