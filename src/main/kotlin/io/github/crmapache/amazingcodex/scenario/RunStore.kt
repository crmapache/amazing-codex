/**
 * Past runs, kept beside the plugin's other machine-wide books rather than in anybody's repository.
 *
 * A run is a fact about what happened on this machine, not about the code: written into the project it
 * would arrive in a pull request and be a second writer of a folder the agent is editing at that very
 * moment. The scenario is the thing worth sharing; what came of it on Tuesday night is not.
 *
 * Two files per run and that is the whole design. `run.json` is the record with the snapshot inside it,
 * tens of kilobytes, read when somebody opens that one run. `summary.json` is the row in the list, and it
 * is what the list is built from - a hundred runs is a hundred small reads rather than a hundred
 * scenarios parsed to draw a date. A folder each, so deleting one takes everything with it in one move.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here is a transcript. Every card of a run is an ordinary conversation of the
 * CLI's and its transcript is already on the disk under the project (see StepTranscript); copying it here
 * would double a night's writing to keep a second copy that can only go stale.
