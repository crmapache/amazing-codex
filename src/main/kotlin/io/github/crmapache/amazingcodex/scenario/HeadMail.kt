/**
 * What the person writes to the head while the run goes, and when the head gets to read it.
 *
 * The head is one conversation from the first card to the last, so a word said to it stands for the rest of
 * the night - which is what writing to it is for. Before this the same thing took a second chat beside the
 * run: talk the run over there, stop it, and hand the work to that chat.
 *
 * What makes it more than "send the text" is that the head is not always free to read. Most of the run it
 * waits - a card is at work, a question waits for the person, the run is paused - and then the words go to it
 * at once, as a turn of their own. But while it answers a question of the run's (the slots, a verdict, another
 * pass) its turn has to end with the object the run moves on, and a turn broken into by a conversation comes
 * back without one; so the words wait, and go first in the next thing said to it. And while it does a card's
 * work itself (see ScenarioEngine.takeOver) the turn can be an hour, and the words are most often about that
 * very work - so they are written into the running turn, which the CLI reads between two of its steps.
 *
 * Kept apart from the engine so that the choice can be tested without a process: the engine says what the
 * head is doing, this says which way the words go.
