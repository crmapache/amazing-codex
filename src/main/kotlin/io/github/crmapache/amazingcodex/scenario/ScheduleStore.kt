/**
 * The hours this project's scenarios are set to start at, kept on the machine beside the runs.
 *
 * Not in the repository, and that is the whole of the placing (see ScenarioSchedule): the round of work
 * is shared, the arrangement with somebody's own morning is not. Beside the runs rather than beside the
 * scenarios for the same reason - both are facts about what this machine does, and both are keyed by a
 * hash of the project's path rather than by the path itself.
 *
 * One file for all of them, and a LIST rather than one hour per scenario: a round of work is the same
 * every time and the thing that differs is when it runs and against what, so three arrangements of one
 * scenario is the ordinary case rather than the odd one. What each of them is called, and how the list is
 * added to, edited and pruned, is Schedules - this only reads and writes the file around it.
