/**
 * The queue of this project, kept on the machine beside the hours and the runs.
 *
 * Not in the repository, for the schedules' reason (see ScheduleStore): the round of work is worth
 * sharing, "these three, tonight, on my checkout" is one person's arrangement with one working copy.
 *
 * The queue survives the IDE being closed, and that is deliberate. Somebody puts three rounds of work on
 * it in the evening; an update, a crash or a reboot in the middle of the night must not be the end of the
 * night's work. What it does NOT survive is a run cut off by that closing - the next turn finds an ending
 * nobody can vouch for and stops, which is the safe way round (see QueueRules.step).
 *
 * What the list means - who is next, what a failure does to it, which turns a deleted scenario takes with
 * it - is QueueRules, where it can be exercised. This reads and writes the file around it.

     * than made afterwards.

     * A move whose write did not land is answered as [QueueMove.Wait]: the turn was not taken, and the next
     * beat will find the queue exactly as it was.
