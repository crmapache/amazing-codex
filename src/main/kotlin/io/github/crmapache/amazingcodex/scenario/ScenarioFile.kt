/**
 * One small JSON file this machine keeps for one project, and the three careful things every such file
 * needs: a lock across IDE windows, a write that is never seen half done, and a reading that says "I could
 * not" apart from "there is nothing".
 *
 * Written once and used by both the scheduled hours and the queue. Two copies of this would not disagree
 * loudly - they would disagree in the one direction nobody watches: one of them writing straight through
 * the file, or holding the lock on the file it is writing, and a list somebody spent a week building
 * disappearing after a power cut with no word anywhere about why.
 *
 * What is NOT here is what the file means. Which records are dropped, which are named, what an unreadable
 * file should make the screen say - that belongs to whoever owns the list (see ScheduleStore, QueueStore),
 * because it differs for each of them and it is the part worth testing.

     * the same old list, both decide the same thing, both write. A lock of its own rather than a lock on
     * the list: on POSIX a lock is released by closing ANY descriptor for that file, so writing the list
     * would drop the lock on the list halfway through the work it is guarding.
     *
     * A filesystem that will not lock (some network shares) is not a reason to refuse the work: it is done
     * unlocked, which is exactly where all of this stood before there was a lock at all.
