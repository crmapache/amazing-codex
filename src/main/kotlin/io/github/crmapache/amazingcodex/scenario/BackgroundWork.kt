/**
 * The helpers a card started in the background and has not heard back from - what tells "this turn
 * ended" from "the card's work ended".
 *
 * A card that hands work to background agents ends its turn the moment it has raised them, with the work
 * only beginning, and every report from one of them starts a turn of the CLI's own accord. Judged on the
 * first ending, such a card reached the head as "sent the plan to three reviewers, waiting for them", and
 * the head spent one of its goes sending it back for the report it was about to write (recorded live on a
 * roas-radar /rr-plan card). Measured on CLI 2.1.280: the agent's `task_started` comes before the turn's
 * `result`, its `task_notification` after it, and then `system:init` and a new turn with the real answer.
 *
 * Two signals, and the newer one wins. `background_tasks_changed` carries the whole set of live background
 * tasks each time it changes, and the CLI's own schema tells hosts to replace their set with it rather
 * than pair the bookends, so that a bookend gone missing cannot hold the set for ever. A CLI that does not
 * send it still sends `task_started` and `task_notification`, which are paired here until the first set
 * arrives. A set belongs to one process: the engine reads each card's process with an object of its own.
 *
 * Waited for is only what reports back, which is a narrower rule than the panel's for its sounds (see
 * SessionSnapshot.pendingAgents). Waiting wrongly costs a card its three-hour ceiling and, most nights,
 * the run; not waiting costs one more go from the head, which is what happened before this. So:
 * - an agent and a workflow are waited for, and so is a backgrounded MCP call, which ends in a result;
 * - a terminal command the card started is not: a dev server never reports anything, the card may leave
 *   one running on purpose, and it is told to wait itself for a command it needs (see HeadTalk.CARD_BRIEFING);
 * - a command one of its helpers started is, for [HELPERS_COMMAND_MS] at most (see [helpersCommands]);
 * - a remote agent is not: the CLI says such a launch never reports an outcome;
 * - nor teammates, monitors or housekeeping (`ambient`), which stay up as long as the process does;
 * - a task with no type at all is an agent - an older CLI sent only subagents down this channel - while a
 *   type this code has never heard of is not waited for, for the reason the whole list is short.

     *
     * A helper that sends its own tests to the background can report "the tests are running, I will
     * answer when they finish" and count as done; the command's end wakes it again, and its real report
     * comes after (recorded on 2.1.280, see the test). Judged in between, the card can be called done on
     * half a review and taken down with the helper still in it. Such a command is waited for - but only
     * for a while, because it may as well be a dev server, and that one never ends.
     *
     * Who started a command is said only by its `task_started`, not by the set, so the two are joined by
     * id: a command counts while it is in the set AND known to be a helper's. Which comes first depends on
     * the command. One started in the background is in the set before its start arrives; one the CLI moved
     * there after the Bash timeout starts in the foreground, outside the set, and joins it minutes later
     * (both measured on 2.1.280). So a helper's mark is never taken off for being missing from a set - a
     * set sent in between, when another helper finished, took it off, and the card was judged on "the
     * command was moved to the background, waiting for it" (caught in the sandbox). It goes with the
     * command's own end, which every task reports, set or no set.
