/**
 * A scenario set to start by itself at a time somebody chose.
 *
 * The whole point of writing a round of work down is that it is the same every time - and a thing that is
 * the same every morning is a thing nobody wants to press a button for. So a scenario can be given an
 * hour and a rhythm, and the panel starts it.
 *
 * A scenario may have as many of these as somebody wants, and that is why [id] exists. Before it, a
 * schedule was known by the scenario it belonged to, which made "another hour for the same round of work"
 * unsayable: the second one replaced the first. What is stored now is a list of arrangements, each with a
 * name of its own, each editable and removable on its own, drawn as a list of its own under the shelves.
 *
 * Kept on the machine rather than in the scenario's file (see ScheduleStore), and the reason is who a
 * schedule belongs to. The round of work is worth sharing through the repository; "at nine, on my
 * machine, with this branch" is one person's arrangement with their own working day, and arriving in a
 * colleague's checkout it would start agents in their working copy at nine in their morning.
