/**
 * What a session said each time it meant to end its turn - not only the last time.
 *
 * The CLI's own account of a turn, the `result` it closes with, is the text of the turn's LAST message,
 * and a turn can end more than once. A project's Stop hook refuses the ending and sends the agent back to
 * work - a style pass over the code it touched, a type check - and the agent's last words are then about
 * that, not about the work. Read from `result` alone, a card that finished a two-hour task with a full
 * report reached the head as "went over the style once more, fixed two comments", and the head sent it
 * back for the report it had already written (recorded live on a roas-radar run: the report and the
 * style note forty seconds apart, the card re-ran every check on the strength of it). Nearly every build
 * card in that project ends that way, because its style hook fires once per session, right after the
 * final report.
 *
 * An ending is a message the model closed with `end_turn`: the one stop reason that means "I am done"
 * rather than "run this tool". The stop reason travels only in the stream's `message_delta` - the
 * `assistant` events carry the text but leave the reason empty - so the text is gathered from those
 * events by message and committed when its delta says it ended the turn. A subagent's messages carry
 * the call that spawned them and are not the session's own (the same mark as AgentStream.isTurnActivity).
 *
 * The `result` stays the safety net. A stream without the deltas - another launch, a CLI that stops
 * sending them - still leaves the last words as they always were, and a result that adds something the
 * endings do not hold is kept beside them.
