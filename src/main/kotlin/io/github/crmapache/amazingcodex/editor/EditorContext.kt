/**
 * What the editor beside the panel is showing: the file in front of the person, and the lines selected in
 * it - handed to the agent with a message, the way Codex does it in a terminal connected to the IDE.
 *
 * Asked for in feedback in those very words: the terminal "adds the open file or selected lines into the
 * context of the conversation automatically", and the panel did not. What a person selects before asking
 * "why is this slow?" is what the question is about, and without it the agent answered about something else
 * or asked which code was meant.
 *
 * Kept up to date as it changes rather than read at the moment of sending, and that is a matter of threads
 * rather than taste: a message arrives on whichever thread carried it in, the editor's selection may be read
 * on the interface thread only, and waiting for that thread from a message's would stall a turn behind
 * whatever the IDE happens to be drawing (see UnsavedEdits, which pays exactly that price because a save has
 * no other way). The copy here is at most [SETTLE_MS] behind the editor, and nobody sends a message that
 * fast after selecting - the hand has to travel to the panel first.
