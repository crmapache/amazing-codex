/**
 * Bringing back into the IDE what the agent has changed on disk.
 *
 * The IDE holds its own picture of the files, and the two ways it has of noticing a change from
 * outside both amount to "eventually": the application regaining focus, and the file watcher of
 * whatever file system the project sits on. A person working with the panel never leaves the
 * application, and a watcher is late or silent often enough to be worth not relying on - a network
 * share, a symlink, a hundred files rewritten in one turn. What they see meanwhile is the editor
 * showing the text the agent has already replaced.
 *
 * So the agent's own stream is what asks for the re-read (see [AgentEdits] for reading it), and this
 * decides what the IDE is asked to do about it.
