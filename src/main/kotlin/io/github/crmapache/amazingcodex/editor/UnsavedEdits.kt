/**
 * The edits still sitting in the editor, written to disk before anything goes looking for the files.
 *
 * The agent has no idea an editor exists: it opens the file on disk and sees what was last written
 * there. The IDE writes editors out when the focus leaves the application - and stepping from the
 * editor into our panel does not leave it, because the panel is the same application. So the ordinary
 * "fixed a line, didn't press save, asked Claude" ends with the agent reading the text as it was
 * before the fix and putting its own version over it. From the person's side that looks like the agent
 * undoing their work, which is exactly how it was reported.
 *
 * Hence this: what the IDE would have saved on Alt+Tab is saved a moment before the turn starts
 * instead. Nothing new happens to the files - the same save, at a moment when it matters.

     * Write out the project's unsaved editors.

     * Synchronously, and before the caller goes on: saving after the text has reached the process is
     * the same race with a shorter fuse. Writing is only allowed on the interface thread, so the check
     * for "nothing to save" is made first, off it - that is the usual case, and it should not have to
     * queue behind whatever the IDE happens to be drawing.
     *
     * Waited for, but not indefinitely. The caller is whichever thread carried the message in, and for
     * a message from a phone that is the relay's own: an IDE sitting behind a modal dialog would hold
     * it there for as long as the dialog stands, and with it every other conversation on that line. A
     * turn that starts a moment early is a worse read of one file; a line that never comes back is
     * remote access gone until somebody walks to the machine.
