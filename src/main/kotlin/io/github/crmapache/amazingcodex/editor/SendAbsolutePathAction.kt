/**
 * A whole file or folder put into the input field by its full path, as an attachment chip - the same as
 * one dragged into the panel with the mouse.
 *
 * One action in three menus. In the editor's it is "Send Absolute Path to Amazing Claude Code GUI", right
 * under "Send to…" for the selected lines. In the project tree's and in the Commit tool window's list of
 * changes it is the only item of ours, right under "Copy Path/Reference…", and goes by the plain "Send to
 * Amazing Claude Code GUI" (see plugin.xml): there is nothing smaller than a file to send from there. The
 * tree's came from a person's idea - the drag was there, but the menu is where one looks first, and it is
 * how other plugins and Cursor do it.
 *
 * The path is the full one, from every menu: it leads to the file from wherever the conversation stands,
 * this project or one raised outside it, while a path from the root leads nowhere in the second. It costs
 * nothing on screen - a chip shows the file's name, whatever the path behind it.
 *
 * Its id in plugin.xml still says "SendSelectionAbsolute", from the days it lived in the editor alone: a
 * person's keymap is filed under that id, and renaming it would silently take their shortcut away.

 *
 * In the tree it stands right under "Copy Path/Reference…", inside the platform's clipboard group - and
 * that group is shared with the main Edit menu, the structure view, the console and the navigation bar.
 * There the item has no business: a person did not open those to send a file. A shortcut and Search
 * Everywhere are not menus, and go through.
 *
 * A menu is told by the kind of UI the event came from, not by its place. The place-based checks are
 * closed to a plugin: the popup one is deprecated, and the one for the macOS menu bar is internal API -
 * the Marketplace verifier flags it and moderation turns the version down. That one also counts a
 * shortcut on a Mac as a menu, so it hid the item from its own shortcut there. The macOS menu bar
 * reports itself as the main menu, like the menu inside the window.

 * that context, so the list may name the file a reference leads to rather than the one on screen. In the
 * project tree and the list of changes it is the whole selection: several files and folders go together,
 * and a deleted file, with nothing left on the disk, drops out on its own.
 *
 * Only files on the local disk are kept: an entry inside a jar under "External Libraries" has a path no
 * agent can read, so for such a node the item does not show at all, and in a mixed selection it is left
