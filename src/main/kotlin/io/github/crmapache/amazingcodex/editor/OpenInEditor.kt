/**
 * A path named in the panel, opened in the IDE's editor.
 *
 * The agent talks in paths all day - the head of every Read and Edit card, "see webview/src/App.tsx:120"
 * in the middle of an answer - and until now not one of them was worth clicking: the panel could send an
 * address to a browser and nothing to the editor two panes away. So a path was read off the screen and
 * typed into "go to file" by hand, which is the one thing an IDE plugin should never make anybody do.
 *
 * Deliberately not restricted to the project's own files. The agent reads a dependency's source, a log
 * under /tmp, a config in the home directory, and a click on the path it just named should open exactly
 * that. What guards this is the door rather than the destination: the request is served by the panel's
 * own handler, which a network client never reaches, `openFile` is refused outright to anyone remote (see
 * RemoteCommands), and a network path is refused on both sides (see below and isOpenablePath).
 *
 * A folder is a destination too, and the one thing it cannot be is opened in the editor: it is shown
 * instead - in the project's tree when it belongs to the project, in the system's file manager when it
 * does not (see [reveal]). Before that a click on one did nothing at all, which is the answer a link must
 * never give: `~/.claude` in an answer looked exactly like a file and behaved like plain text.
 *
 * A name is found the way "go to file" finds it. Half of what the agent writes in backticks is a bare
 * name - `Button.js`, `UserService.java` - and the first release of this looked for it at the project's
 * root only, so for any source file in a folder the click did nothing at all, silently: the very first
 * review of the feature said exactly that. Now a name that is not at the root is looked up across the
 * project by the index, narrowed by whatever folders were written in front of it, and when several files
 * are left the person picks (see [byName], [rank]).
