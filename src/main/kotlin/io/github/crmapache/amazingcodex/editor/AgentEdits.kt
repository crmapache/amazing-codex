/**
 * What the agent has just changed on disk, read off its own stream.
 *
 * The IDE keeps its own picture of the disk and refreshes it when the application regains focus or
 * when its file watcher gets round to the change. Neither promises a moment: a person answering the
 * agent from the panel never leaves the application at all, and a watcher is exactly as reliable as
 * the file system under it - a network share, a symlink, a hundred edits in one turn, and it is late
 * or silent. Meanwhile the editor on screen still shows the text the agent has already rewritten.
 *
 * So the stream is read for the same facts twice: the statistics count what was changed, this says
 * what to re-read (see DiskRefresh, which does the re-reading).
 *
 * The work is split in two on purpose - what a line means can be checked in a test, what the IDE does
 * about it cannot.
