/**
 * Sealing a body so that only the other end can open it.
 *
 * AES-256-GCM: it encrypts and authenticates in one pass, and the authentication is the half that
 * matters most here. The relay forwards bytes it cannot read; without a tag it could still alter them,
 * and an altered frame that decrypts into something plausible is worse than one that fails.
 *
 * The frame's own header goes in as additional data rather than being ignored - all of it, the wire
 * version and the kind of frame included. It is not secret, the relay routes by it, but it is covered
 * by the tag: nobody can take a frame addressed to one device and re-address it to another, and nobody
 * can relabel an envelope as "wake this phone" to have it handed to a push service instead. The tag
 * stops matching, and the frame is dropped.
 *
 * The one rule this scheme dies of if broken: a key and a nonce must never be used twice together.
 * That is why the nonce is a per-direction prefix plus a counter, why each direction has a key of its
 * own, and why keys are derived afresh from ephemeral material on every connection - a restarted agent
 * cannot resurrect an old counter under an old key, because the key is gone.
