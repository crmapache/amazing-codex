 * What a device has already been sent, and when to stop remembering it.
 *
 * The memory itself is one fingerprint per device per slot (see RemoteAgent.newFacts) and it used to be
 * about twenty entries: one per kind of message. A scenario run puts an identifier into the slot, which is
 * what lets two runs going side by side be told apart on the wire - and that turned a small fixed table
 * into one that grows by a row per run for as long as the IDE is open. A scenario on a morning schedule
 * plus the runs somebody starts by hand is hundreds of rows a year, per paired device, none of them ever
 * looked at again.
 *
 * Here rather than inside the client because it fails quietly in both directions. Forgetting too eagerly
 * costs one frame that had already been sent; forgetting nothing costs memory for as long as the window is
 * open, and nothing ever says so.

     * another project all leave behind every slot they ever had here, and nothing else would ever remove
     * them. By who is being told anything at all rather than by "still paired", because a device that

     * the overview facts are what its first screen is drawn from, and it is better to say them twice than
     * to leave a card blank because of what its predecessor under the same address once received.

     * The second is the backstop for the device that stays on one project all year while a scenario runs
     * every morning.
