/**
 * This IDE's own key pair, and the shared secrets it has with paired devices.
 *
 * The curve is P-256 rather than the newer X25519, and the reason is the other end: a browser's
 * WebCrypto has had P-256 since forever and X25519 only recently, so a phone a couple of versions
 * behind would simply have no way to pair. The security difference between them is not what decides
 * this; being able to pair at all is.
 *
 * The private half lives in the IDE's password safe, which is the system keychain rather than a file
 * in a config directory. Two things follow from that and both matter:
 *
 * - reading it can block on the system keychain, so it never happens on the interface thread;
 * - the safe can be configured to keep nothing between restarts, and then the keys quietly vanish
 *   every time. Rather than leave a person pairing their phone forever without knowing why, that case
 *   is detected outright (see [usable]).
 *
 * The record is named after the agent id rather than the plugin, because the keychain is shared across
 * every JetBrains IDE on the machine while the id is per configuration directory. Under one name, two
 * products would share a key and not share a device registry, which ends with them displacing each
 * other on the relay forever.
