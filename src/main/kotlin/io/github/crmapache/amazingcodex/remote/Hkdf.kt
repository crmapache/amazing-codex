/**
 * Turning one shared secret into the several keys that are actually used.
 *
 * Written out here because JDK 21 has no HKDF of its own - `javax.crypto.KDF` is a preview feature of a
 * later release, and a plugin cannot ask an IDE to run on a different JVM. The browser half needs none
 * of this: `crypto.subtle.deriveBits({name: 'HKDF'})` has been standard for years. So only this side
 * is hand-written, and it is thirty lines of a specification (RFC 5869) rather than a scheme of our own.
 *
 * Why not simply use the shared secret as the key: it is one value, and the same key used in both
 * directions is how a message sent to you gets replayed back at you and accepted. Each direction gets
 * its own key and its own nonce prefix, and the two never meet.
