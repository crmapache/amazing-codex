 * machine. So the question is not what a well-behaved phone needs - it needs very little - but what a
 * phone in somebody else's hands could do before anyone notices. Every number here is an answer to
 * that, and each says which of the two it is protecting: the machine's work, or its memory.
 *

 * five permissions in ten seconds is an ordinary morning, while sending five messages in ten seconds
