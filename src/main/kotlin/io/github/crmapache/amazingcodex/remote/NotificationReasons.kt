/**
 * Whether something that just happened is worth waking a phone for.
 *
 * The panel answers this same question already (see sounds.ts) and answers it from the feed, which is
 * the natural place: the feed is where a permission is a card and a turn's end is a line. This side has
 * no feed - it has a journal and a snapshot - and gaining one would mean carrying sixteen hundred lines
 * of TypeScript into Kotlin.
 *
 * So the question is answered from what this side does have. Six of the seven occasions turn out to be
 * visible without a feed: three are simply "is the conversation stopped waiting for a person", and the
 * other three are recognisable in the raw stream. The seventh - extra usage beginning - is not a
 * message at all but a change of state, and is announced by the side that keeps that state (see
 * [EXTRA_USAGE]). The one thing that must not drift is the order of importance, which is why it is
 * stated here as a list and checked against the panel's copy by a test.
 *
 * The decision belongs on this side rather than the phone's because the phone is asleep - that is the
 * entire point of a notification - and because the text is sealed here (see phase 5 in the plan): a
 * relay that could decide what is worth notifying about would be a relay that knows what happened.
