/**
 * A message from a device that did not fit in one frame, put back together.
 *
 * One frame through the relay is capped at 256 KB (see RelayLink.MAX_FRAME_BYTES), and a photo from a
 * phone is not. Squeezed into a single frame, a detailed shot came out at 660 pixels and still did not
 * fit, so the phone refused it with "try one photo at a time" over exactly one photo (2026-10-01). Raising
 * the cap would raise it for every frame of every kind, and for every queue on the way that holds them.
 * Instead a message too big for one frame travels as several, each an ordinary sealed frame, and is
 * joined here.
 *
 * A part carries a slice of the message's own text, so what comes out is exactly what would have arrived
 * whole, and it goes through exactly the same door (see RemoteAgent.part). What is bounded here is what a
 * device can make this side hold: how big a message may grow, how many parts it may claim, how many may
 * be half-built at once and for how long. Every part has already been counted against the device's
 * allowance by weight (see RemoteLimits.allowBytes) - this is about memory, not about rate.
