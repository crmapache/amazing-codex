 * rather than a promise: routing reads two fixed offsets, and there is no parser on that side that
 * could be pointed at the rest.
 *
 * The same header carries a plaintext body in phase 2 and a sealed one from phase 3 onwards - the
 * relay does not change between the two, because it never knew the difference. This is the mirror of
 * relay/src/wire/frame.ts, and the two are obliged to agree byte for byte.
