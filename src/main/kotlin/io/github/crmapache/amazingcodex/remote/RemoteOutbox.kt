/**
 * What is waiting to go out while there is nothing to send it over.
 *
 * A phone's connection breaks constantly - a lift, a tunnel, a laptop asleep - and the events do not
 * stop for it. Something has to hold them, and it has to hold them without letting a night without
 * signal turn into a gigabyte of heap in someone's IDE.
 *
 * The interesting decision is what happens when it fills up. Dropping the oldest and carrying on
 * produces a feed with a hole in it that neither side can see. So instead the queue collapses into a
 * single marker meaning "ask again from your last number": the client then catches up from the
 * journal, which has all of it anyway, and the memory this can hold is bounded by construction rather
 * than by how long the network was down.
 *
 * A QUEUE PER DEVICE, which is the part that had to change. One queue meant one fate: a phone in a
 * tunnel filled the queue that belonged to everybody, and the collapse threw away the frames of the
 * laptop sitting on the desk with a perfectly good connection - and told it to ask again for a feed it
 * had never lost. With a conversation open in three places that stopped being an edge case and became
 * the ordinary day. The ceilings are per device for the same reason: what one device may cost this
 * IDE's memory should not depend on how many others are paired.
