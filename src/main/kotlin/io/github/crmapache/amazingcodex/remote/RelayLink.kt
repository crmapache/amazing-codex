/**
 * The one connection out to the relay, and everything that keeps it standing.
 *
 * Outgoing on purpose: an IDE sits behind a home router, and nothing from the outside can reach it.
 * Every remote arrangement that works works this way round - the machine dials out and holds the line.
 *
 * One socket per IDE process, with every project multiplexed inside it. The alternative - a connection
 * per project - would multiply the reconnect storms by the number of windows someone happens to have
 * open, for no gain at all: the relay routes by address, and the address is the process's.
 *
 * The client is the JDK's own. Adding a websocket library to a plugin's archive risks a class clash
 * with the IDE itself and buys nothing here.
