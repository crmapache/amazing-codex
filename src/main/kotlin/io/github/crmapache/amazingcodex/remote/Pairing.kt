/**
 * Letting a phone in, once.
 *
 * The whole difficulty is that the two ends meet through a server neither of them trusts. A plain key
 * exchange over such a server is trivially defeated: the server hands each side its own key, reads
 * everything, and both ends see a working connection. The QR code is what closes that - it carries a
 * secret over a channel the relay is not on, namely your eyes, and both sides prove they saw it.
 *
 * What is derived is deliberately more than one key: a key per direction, a nonce prefix per direction,
 * and a long-lived one for reconnecting later without another QR code. Reusing a single key in both
 * directions is how a message sent to you gets replayed back at you and accepted.
 *
 * Ephemeral keys as well as the long-lived ones, so that recording today's traffic and stealing a key
 * next year does not open it: this connection's keys are gone the moment it ends.
