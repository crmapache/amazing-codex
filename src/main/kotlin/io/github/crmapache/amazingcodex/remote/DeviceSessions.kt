/**
 * The live cryptographic state for each paired device: which keys this connection runs on, what the
 * next counter is, and what has already been seen.
 *
 * Kept in memory and nowhere else, on purpose. The counters must never repeat under a key, and the
 * cheapest way to guarantee that is for the keys not to outlive the process: every connection derives
 * fresh ones from fresh ephemeral material, so a restarted IDE cannot resurrect an old counter under
 * an old key. Persisting them would buy nothing and put the one rule this scheme dies of at the mercy
 * of a file write.
 *
 * What does persist is the long-lived key from pairing (in the keychain, see RemoteKeys) - and it is
 * used only to prove who the parties are, never to encrypt anything.
