/**
 * Who this agent is, and which devices have been let in.
 *
 * The first component of its kind in this plugin - everything else lives in PropertiesComponent, which
 * is right for a scalar and wrong for a list of records with five fields each. Squeezing a device
 * registry into comma-separated strings would be a hack with a paragraph of explanation attached.
 *
 * Roaming is off, deliberately and permanently. A pairing says "this phone may talk to this machine";
 * carrying it to another machine through settings sync would either be meaningless or - if the keys
 * went with it - a way to hand someone else's laptop the keys to your work machine.
 *
 * The keys themselves are not here: they belong in the system keychain (see phase 3). What is here is
 * the open part - who, when, and what their fingerprint is - so the panel can list them without
 * touching a secret store on every repaint.
