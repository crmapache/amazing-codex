/**
 * The panel's own keys: the next and the previous tab, a new one, closing the one on screen, opening again the
 * one closed last, and Queue.
 *
 * They are actions of the IDE rather than keys the page listens for, because the IDE has the keyboard
 * first. A press reaches the keymap before the embedded browser sees it, so a page listening for Cmd+W
 * would never hear one: the IDE would already have spent it on Close Tab (the wall Ctrl+V hit on Linux,
 * see PasteKeys). As actions they also live where a JetBrains user looks for keys - Settings | Keymap,
 * under the plugin, where each can be rebound - and in Find Action.
 *
 * Three of them take the keys of the IDE's own tab actions (`use-shortcut-of` in plugin.xml): whatever
 * moves between and closes editor tabs in this person's keymap does the same to the panel's tabs while
 * the focus is in the panel, and follows when that keymap changes. New tab and the closed one opened again take
 * the browser's pair - Cmd+T and Cmd+Shift+T on a Mac, Ctrl+T and Ctrl+Shift+T elsewhere: the second one is a
 * reflex long before anybody looks for it in a cheat sheet, and the reflex is the whole of what it is for.
 *
 * Two roads lead to the same command. A press inside the panel is caught by an action registered on the
 * browser itself ([install]): the IDE asks the focused component's own shortcuts before the keymap's, so
 * there - and only there - the panel's action wins over Close Tab, Update Project or Show Context Actions
 * bound to the same key. The actions in plugin.xml ([PanelKeyAction]) are what Keymap lists and what Find
 * Action runs; outside the panel they stand disabled, which leaves the key to whatever else owns it.
