/**
 * The debug report a person may attach to a piece of feedback - and the promise that goes with it.
 *
 * The promise is that it carries technical facts only: what versions were in play, what shape the
 * conversation had, and anything that failed. Not what was asked, not what was answered, not which files
 * were touched, not where the project lives on the disk.
 *
 * That promise is kept by how this is built rather than by care taken while building it. The journal of
 * a conversation is the whole conversation - every message a person typed, every answer, and the
 * contents of every file the agent read (see SessionJournal). So nothing is copied out of it. Each entry
 * is read for its shape - which event, which tool, how many bytes, did it fail, how long since the last
 * one - and a line is written from those facts. A field this file does not know about contributes
 * nothing; the way to leak something new is to add it here on purpose.
 *
 * File names are the one thing in between. Which files were involved matters when reading a bug ("it
 * read the same file four times"), and their names cannot travel. So a path becomes twelve characters of
 * its hash, exactly as the statistics already do it (see StatsCollector.hashOf): the same file reads as
 * the same file, and no hash says which one.
 *
 * The whole thing is shown to the person before it goes anywhere, and what they read is this string.
 * There is no second, fuller version for the wire.
