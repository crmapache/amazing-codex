/**
 * The IDE's side of the feedback screen: the picked files, the report, and the one request that leaves
 * this machine.
 *
 * It lives with the panel's window rather than with the conversation hub, and that placement is the
 * point. Everything about a conversation goes through SessionCommands, which is also the door a paired
 * phone comes in by; this goes through the window's own handler instead, where a remote client does not
 * arrive at all (see CodexPanel). A message that makes the IDE read files off the disk and post them to
 * a server should be unreachable from outside by construction, not only by being on a list - though it is
 * on that list too (see RemoteCommands).
