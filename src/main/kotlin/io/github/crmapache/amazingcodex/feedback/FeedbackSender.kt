/**
 * Posting a piece of feedback to the service that hands it on.
 *
 * This is the plugin's first genuine HTTP request. Everything it did over the network before now went
 * through the relay, and that is a websocket the person had to switch on themselves - so the whole shape
 * of "make a request and read a response" is new here, and it is built out of the same parts that one is:
 * the IDE's proxy settings and the IDE's certificate store (see RemoteAgent.httpClient), because inside a
 * company neither is optional and a plugin that ignores them fails in a way that looks like the server
 * being down.
 *
 * Why the bytes travel from here rather than from the panel: the bridge between the page and the IDE has
 * no size checks and no chunking in this direction, and a message too large to cross it is lost silently -
 * no exception, nothing in the log (see WebviewHost). Twenty megabytes of attachment would be exactly
 * that. So the panel names files by id and the IDE reads them off the disk itself.
 *
 * multipart/form-data assembled by hand, because the JDK has no builder for it, and the bodies are handed
 * over as a list of arrays rather than one joined buffer - the parts are already in memory once and there
 * is no reason for them to be there twice.
