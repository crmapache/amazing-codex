/**
 * The last few hundred technical things that happened, kept so that a person reporting a bug has
 * something to attach to it.
 *
 * Until this existed there was nothing to attach. Every one of the plugin's ninety-odd log calls goes
 * straight into the IDE's own idea.log, which a person has to find, open, and read past everything the
 * platform and every other plugin wrote into it - and then decide for themselves which lines were about
 * this. Asking that of somebody who has just hit a bug is asking them not to report it.
 *
 * One buffer for the whole application rather than one per project, for the same reason the statistics
 * are kept that way: a bug does not belong to a project, and the thing worth seeing is usually the
 * order events happened in across everything the IDE had open.
 *
 * It holds nothing on disk and dies with the IDE. That is deliberate: this is a buffer for a report
 * written now, not a record of how the plugin has been used. A file would have to be trimmed, migrated,
 * and explained on the privacy page - and it would answer a question nobody asked.
 *
 * What must never come in here is content. The temptation is one line away: several places in the
 * plugin already log a whole message from the panel when they cannot make sense of it, and such a
 * message carries the text a person typed. The rule is that a caller passes what happened and how big
 * it was, never the thing itself - see the note beside "Unknown message from webview" in CodexPanel.
