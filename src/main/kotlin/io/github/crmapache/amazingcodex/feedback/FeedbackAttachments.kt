/**
 * The files a person picked for a piece of feedback.
 *
 * The list lives here, in the IDE, and the panel is told only an id, a name and a size for each. It never
 * learns a path. Two things follow, and both are the reason it is built this way:
 *
 * - a screen whose whole purpose is to send things to somebody else's server cannot leak a path it was
 *   never given, not by a bug and not by a message crafted to look like one;
 * - and the panel cannot name a file the person did not pick. Sending is "the file behind id 3", not "the
 *   file at this path" - so there is no path for anything to put its own value into. The same shape the
 *   list of recent projects already uses for the phone (see RemoteAgent.recents).
 *
 * Sizes are read from the disk rather than taken from whoever offered the file, and read again when the
 * thing is actually sent: a log file being appended to right now is the likeliest attachment there is.
