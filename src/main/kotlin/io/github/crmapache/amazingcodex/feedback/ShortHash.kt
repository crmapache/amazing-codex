/**
 * A few characters of a hash, standing in for something that must not travel.
 *
 * The same digest the statistics already use for file names and project keys (see StatsCollector), kept
 * here in one place because two parts of the feedback report need it: the outline of a conversation, where
 * a path becomes a mark that says "the same file again", and the buffer of technical lines, where a path
 * that turned up inside somebody else's error message becomes the same kind of mark.
 *
 * Short on purpose. This is not a commitment that two different paths can never collide - it is a way to
 * say "this one again" inside one report without saying which one.
