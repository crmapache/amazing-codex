/**
 * The statistics' memory: every project's days and every achievement's tiers, kept for the whole
 * machine rather than for one project or one IDE.
 *
 * One service for the application rather than one per project, because the figures are about a person:
 * "a hundred hours in the panel" is a hundred hours wherever they were spent, and a streak does not
 * break because yesterday's work was in another project. The file lives in the directory JetBrains
 * products share, so WebStorm and IntelliJ count into one and the same book (see [directory]).
 *
 * Writes go through [update] under a lock and are put on disk a little later rather than at once: the
 * ticker marks a minute every half-minute in every busy project, and a file rewritten that often would
 * be noise on the disk for nothing. What is dirty is written within [SAVE_DELAY_SECONDS], and at the
 * IDE's shutdown whatever is left (see [dispose]).
