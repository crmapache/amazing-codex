/**
 * The fifty-two achievements, five tiers each, and the figures they are measured by.
 *
 * The rules live here, on the IDE's side, rather than in the interface: a tier is earned at the moment
 * the figure crosses the line, and that moment has to be written down whether or not a panel happens to
 * be open - a turn answered from a phone at night earns exactly as much as one at the desk. The words,
 * the icons and the paint live in the interface (see webview/src/stats/catalogue.ts), keyed by the same
 * ids; a test on either side fails if the two lists drift apart.
 *
 * Every figure is a count, a sum or a high-water mark over the day records (see [Metrics]), so none of
 * them goes down as the work goes on - and a tier once earned is not taken back even when the counting
 * itself changes under it, which is a rule of [evaluate] rather than a happy consequence of the figures.
 * A ladder names five lines to cross; a milestone names one and lights all five at once - "your first
 * fork" is not a thing that comes in fifths.
