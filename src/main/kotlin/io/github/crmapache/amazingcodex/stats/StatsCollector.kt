/**
 * What one project contributes to the statistics: it watches the conversations and writes what it sees
 * into the ledger, day by day.
 *
 * It is told about things rather than asking: the hub hands it every line of the agent's stream, every
 * message a person sends, every permission decided, every tab opened. What arrives here is turned into
 * the figures of a day record (see DayRecord) and nothing else is remembered - except what a figure
 * cannot be made from one event alone: the tool calls of a turn waiting for their results, the minutes
 * of a conversation that add up to its longest stretch, the ends of the last hour's turns.
 *
 * Time in the panel is marked by minute (see MinuteSet) from three sources at once: a turn running (the
 * ticker marks every half-minute while one does), a person acting (a message, a decision), and a hand on
 * the keyboard or the wheel (the panel reports that itself, once in a while). None of the three can
 * count a minute the others already counted.
