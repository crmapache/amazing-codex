/**
 * What the statistics remember: one record per project per calendar day, and the achievements' tiers
 * with the moment each was reached.
 *
 * A day is the unit on purpose. Every figure the tab shows for "the last 7 days", "the last 30 days" or
 * "all time" is a sum, a maximum or a count over these records, so the range is chosen at the moment of
 * looking rather than at the moment of counting - and the achievements, which are about all time, fold
 * the same records. Nothing is kept twice.
 *
 * Every field grows or stays: a count, a sum, a high-water mark. That is what lets two records of the
 * same day be merged by taking the larger of each (see [StatsSnapshot.mergedWith]) when two IDEs turn
 * out to have been writing the same file.
 *
 * Two records of the same day in different projects are put together the other way - counts added, marks
 * kept at the higher, minutes joined (see [foldedWith]) - and that is what the tab counts over: the day
 * of a person rather than of a project.
