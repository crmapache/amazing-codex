 * active or it is not, and marking the same minute twice costs nothing. That is what makes the sources
 * easy to add up - a turn running, a message sent, a hand on the keyboard - without one of them counting
 * a moment the other has already counted. The hour-of-day breakdown the calendar draws falls out of the
 * same bits for free.
