 * itself can only be carried into JS safely as a literal, so we encode it with the serializer and parse
 * it back on the page: otherwise the first quotation mark or newline inside an answer's text would tear
 * the whole call apart, and the channel would fall silent entirely.
 *
 * A long batch is handed over in parts rather than in one call. Every trip into the page is a message
 * between processes, and one too large simply does not reach it: silently, with no exception and no log
 * entry. What got lost then was not one card but a whole piece of the conversation together with the
 * turn's result - the panel stayed "thinking" forever over an answer that had long since arrived. A
 * review turn with a dozen subagents, where every event carries a finished report, is the easiest way
