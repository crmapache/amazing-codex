/**
 * Taking in files and folders dropped into the panel with the mouse - both from the IDE itself and from
 * the system file manager.
 *
 * We catch this here rather than in the page, because dragging inside the IDE - from the project tree,
 * from the editor's tabs - does not go through the system mechanism but through one of the platform's
 * own (DnDManager): it carries what is dragged itself, by mouse events, and that simply never reaches
 * the embedded browser - the page receives not a single event, however many handlers hang there.
 *
 * enableAsNativeTarget adds system dragging to that - the way a file arrives from a file manager.
 *
 * A drop can land anywhere in the panel, while what lights up is the input field alone: the file will
 * become a chip precisely there, and the frame shows where it will end up rather than where to aim the
 * mouse (see onDragging).
