     * Built through [Proxy] rather than by a class of our own implementing the interface, and that is the
     * whole point of this file: the interface is not the same shape in every IDE. Since 2026.2 it asks for
     * seven methods - `open`, `read` and `skip` on top of the older four - and the types in the new
     * signatures (the read and skip callbacks, and `LongRef` beside them) do not exist in 2026.1 at all,
     * which is what Android Studio is built on. A class naming them in its own signatures cannot be loaded
     * there: the plugin verifier calls it NoSuchClassError, and the panel would simply never come up.
     * Naming only the older four does not work either - against 2026.2 such a class is three
     * implementations short and does not compile.
     *
     * A proxy is made from the interface as it is in the IDE that is running, so one archive answers the
     * four-method shape and the seven-method one alike, and the next change to this interface is not
     * something this code has to be taught about beforehand.
     *
     * Both sets do the same thing, deliberately: which of them CEF calls depends on its version, and it
     * has been checked live that the current build calls the older pair. That is also why inheriting the
     * ready adapter was never an option - it answers the older pair with a refusal, and the panel then
     * loads nothing at all.
