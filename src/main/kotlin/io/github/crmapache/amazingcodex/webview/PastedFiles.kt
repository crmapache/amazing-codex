 * Anything pasted into the panel that has bytes but no file: a screenshot off the clipboard, a document
 * copied in a file manager.

 * Such bytes have nowhere to live. The panel holds them inside the message and the agent is handed them
 * as an attachment, so on screen the attachment is a chip saying "Image #3" - and that is all anyone can
 * take away from it. Copy such a message and the clipboard gets that caption: a name for something that
 * exists in no place a person could open, mail or point anybody at. With a file behind it the attachment
 * behaves like every other one - copied as a path, opened in the editor, named to somebody else.
 *
 * Written here rather than in the project: a screenshot pasted into a chat is not part of anybody's
 * source tree, and a plugin that drops files into a working copy is a plugin one notices in `git status`.
 * The IDE's own system folder is where a tool's own leftovers belong, and what is left there is swept up
 * by age (see [sweep]).
