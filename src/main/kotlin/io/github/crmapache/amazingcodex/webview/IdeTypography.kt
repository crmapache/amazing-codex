/**
 * The IDE's fonts in the shape the panel's page understands.
 *
 * In spirit the panel is a terminal, so its contents are drawn in the same font as the console: the
 * name, the size and the line spacing come from the colour scheme ("Editor | Color Scheme | Console
 * Font") - that is what the built-in terminal shows, the one where a person saw the real Claude Code.
 * What surrounds the contents (the header, the input field, the selectors) uses the IDE's interface
 * font, as any native tool window does.
 *
 * The size arrives not as a number for CSS but as a multiplier: the whole page is scaled by the
 * embedded browser's zoom, and the entire layout - paddings, chips, icons - grows along with the text.
 * There is no need to recompute a hundred sizes in the styles for that, and popup menu coordinates stay
 * consistent with the window (unlike CSS zoom, which would shift them relative to positions computed in
 * JavaScript).
