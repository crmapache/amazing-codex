 * inside JCEF, and there is no download manager behind it to ask. So the page draws the picture, hands
 * over the bytes (see the saveImage message), and the file is written here.
 *
 * The name that arrives is treated as a name and nothing else - see [safeName]. The page is ours, but a
 * message that says where to write is a message that can be made to say anything, and the folder is not
 * up for discussion.
