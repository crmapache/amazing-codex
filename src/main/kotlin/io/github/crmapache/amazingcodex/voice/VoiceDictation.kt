/**

 *
 * Application-wide rather than per project because the microphone is: two panels recording at once
 * would be two applications fighting over one device, and the second would simply fail. Which panel the
 * words go to is decided when the dictation starts (see [Sink]) - the one whose window was in front, or
 * the one whose button was pressed.
 *
 * Nothing about the audio is kept. Chunks go from the line into the socket and are forgotten; no file is
 * written, and no text is stored beyond the phrase on its way to the input field.
