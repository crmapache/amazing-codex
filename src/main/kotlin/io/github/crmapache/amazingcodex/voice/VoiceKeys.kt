/**
 * The Deepgram key, in the system keychain rather than in a settings file.
 *
 * The same place the remote access keys live (see RemoteKeys) and for the same reason: this one buys
 * transcription with somebody's money, and a settings file is world-readable, backed up and synced.
 *
 * It never travels back to the panel. The screen is told whether a key is set and what its last four
 * characters are - enough to tell "the one I pasted" from "some other one" - and nothing more: the panel
 * is a web page in an embedded browser, and a secret that never enters it cannot leave through it.
 *
 * Reading can block on the system keychain, so it never happens on the interface thread.
