/**
 * Live transcription over Deepgram's websocket. Wiring only: open, feed audio, ask for the tail, hand
 * the words on. It knows nothing about dictations, the input field or the settings - that is
 * [VoiceDictation].
 *
 * A socket rather than one request with a file at the end, and the difference is where the waiting
 * happens. A file is posted once the person has stopped talking, so the connection, the upload and the
 * whole transcription are paid for while they sit looking at a spinner. A socket opens as the recording
 * starts, the speech flows into it as it is spoken, and letting go of the key leaves only the tail to
 * count - measured next door in notastream at 135 ms against 0.8-1.4 s for the batch route.
 *
 * The key travels as an `Authorization` header, which is the documented form and is available here
 * precisely because this is not a browser: a page's WebSocket cannot set headers at all, which is why
 * the same feature in an Electron app had to go looking for an undocumented subprotocol.
 *
 * The phone holds the same conversation and holds it separately (webview/src/mobile/dictation.ts): one
 * side is Kotlin in the IDE, the other a page in somebody's hand, and there is no code between them. So
 * this is the case of Frame.kt and frame.ts - the query parameters, the shape of an answer and the three
 * timings below are kept the same by discipline, and a change here is a change there. Nothing breaks
 * when they drift: the phone simply transcribes a little differently from the desk, which is the kind of
 * difference nobody reports and nobody finds.
