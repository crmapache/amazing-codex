/**
 * What a person presses to start dictating: a chord on the keyboard, or a button on the mouse.
 *
 * Two shapes rather than one, and the difference is not cosmetic. A chord is assembled - it is held
 * down in pieces and let go in pieces, which is the whole of push-to-talk - while a mouse button is
 * whole from the first instant. Folding them together would mean one of them pretending to have
 * modifiers it can never carry.
 *
 * The side of the keyboard is part of a chord ([Keys.location]) because of what it makes possible: a
 * binding of one bare modifier. "Hold the right Option" collides with nothing in the IDE's keymap - a
 * modifier on its own activates no action anywhere - which makes it the only kind of chord that is
 * safe to hold down for ten seconds in the middle of an editor. It is also what Wispr Flow and
 * Superwhisper bind by default, so it is what a hand already knows.
