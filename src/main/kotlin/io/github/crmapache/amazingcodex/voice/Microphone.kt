/**

 * `http://acx-webview` (see WebviewResources), which is not a secure context, so `navigator.mediaDevices`
 * is simply absent there. Making it appear would mean a CEF command-line flag, and CEF's flags are set
 * for the whole IDE process - every other plugin's browser included. Recording here costs nothing by
 * comparison: `javax.sound.sampled` is in the JDK, macOS already grants the IDE the microphone
 * (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in its Info.plist, `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` in its
 * entitlements), and the same thread can hold a socket open to Deepgram with an `Authorization` header,
 * which a browser's WebSocket cannot do at all.
 *
 * The line is opened when dictation starts rather than kept warm. An open line is a microphone taken
 * away from every other application on the machine, and a panel that quietly owns the microphone all day
 * is a panel nobody would keep installed.
