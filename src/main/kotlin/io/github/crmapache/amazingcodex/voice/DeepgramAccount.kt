/**
 * What the key is worth: whether Deepgram accepts it at all, and how much credit is left behind it.
 *
 * The balance is the reason this exists. The whole feature runs on the $200 Deepgram hands out at
 * sign-up, which is hundreds of hours of dictation, so the honest thing is to show how much of it is
 * still there rather than let somebody find out by being cut off mid-sentence.
 *
 * The awkward part is a fact about Deepgram rather than about us: reading a balance needs `billing:read`,
 * which only the owner and admin roles have. A key made with the member role transcribes perfectly and
 * cannot see the balance at all - so that case is a state of its own ([Answer.NoBillingAccess]) and the
 * screen says what it means, instead of showing a failure over a key that works.
