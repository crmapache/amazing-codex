 * It lives with the panel's window rather than with the conversation hub, exactly like FeedbackDesk and
 * for the same reason: everything about a conversation travels through SessionCommands, which is also
 * the door a paired phone comes in by, while these messages arrive at the window's own handler where a
 * remote client does not appear at all (see CodexPanel). A message that opens a microphone on somebody's
 * desk and spends their Deepgram credit should be unreachable from outside by construction rather than
 * only by being on a list - though it is on that list too (see RemoteCommands).
