/**
 * A phone's way into dictation: a token that lasts a minute, instead of the key that lasts for ever.
 *
 * The phone records and talks to Deepgram itself rather than sending audio here to be forwarded, and
 * both halves of that are deliberate. Audio through the relay would be a live stream of somebody's voice
 * crossing a server whose whole design is that it can carry nothing but sealed envelopes it cannot read
 * (see SECURITY-REMOTE-CONTROL.md) - and it would arrive late, because every chunk would travel twice.
 * Straight to Deepgram it is one hop, and the relay never sees a byte of it.
 *
 * What the phone must never get is the key itself. A key is money with no expiry: whoever holds it can
 * spend the account until somebody notices. So the IDE mints a token instead - `POST /v1/auth/grant`,
 * good for one minute and for transcription only (`usage:write`), useless against the account's own
 * settings. A phone that is stolen an hour later holds a string that expired fifty-nine minutes ago.
 *
 * The door is narrow on purpose (see RemoteCommands): this is the one voice message a remote client may
 * send, and it is refused unless the person has switched voice input on at the desk and left a key here.
