/**
 * The state machine behind the dictation hotkeys: which presses start it, which end it, and which are
 * neither.
 *
 * Deliberately free of AWT and of the panel - it is handed plain numbers and answers with three verbs.
 * That separation is the point: this is the piece that goes subtly wrong (a chord half let go, an
 * auto-repeat read as a second press, a keyboard release stopping what the mouse started) and the only
 * way to be sure of it is a test that presses a hundred keys in a row. [VoiceHotkeys] is the thin adapter
 * that feeds it real events.
 *
 * Two modes, and the difference is what a press means the second time:
 *
 * - [Mode.PUSH_TO_TALK] - held. It records while the chord is down and stops the moment any part of it
 *   is let go, like a walkie-talkie.
 * - [Mode.HOLD_TALK] - toggled. One press starts it, the next press stops it, and the hands are free in
 *   between. This is the one for a long thought.
 *
 * Each mode takes two bindings, a chord and a mouse button, and they are independent triggers of the
 * same thing: a release from the keyboard must not stop what a mouse button started, or the record
 * would end on an unrelated key going up.
