/**
 * The keys that start dictation, and the screen that records them.
 *
 * Events are taken from the IDE's own queue rather than from a native hook, and that is the decision the
 * whole feature is shaped around. A system-wide hook would work with the IDE in the background, and it
 * costs: on macOS an Accessibility grant, on every platform a native binary, and in practice a licence -
 * the library everyone uses for it is GPL, which this plugin cannot take. The alternatives that are not
 * GPL do not report key releases at all, and without a release there is no push-to-talk. So the rule is
 * plain and says so on the settings screen: the hotkey works while the IDE has the keyboard.
 *
 * Taking events from the queue also lets a chord be swallowed. Ctrl+Shift+D held for five seconds would
 * otherwise fire whatever the keymap has on it, five seconds of dictation and an unrelated action at
 * once - so the dispatcher answers "handled" for the presses that are ours.
