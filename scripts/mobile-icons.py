"""
The phone client's icons, rendered from the plugin's own logo.

They are generated rather than drawn so that there is one master (src/main/resources/META-INF/
pluginIcon.svg) and no second copy of the mark to keep in step. Run this after the logo changes:

    python3 scripts/mobile-icons.py

Needs rsvg-convert (brew install librsvg) and Pillow.

Two shapes come out of it, because the platforms ask for different things:

  * icon-192 / icon-512  - the logo as it is, rounded corners and all. Used where a browser puts the
    icon on a surface of its own and does not crop it.
  * the maskable pair    - full bleed, no transparency, the mark inside the safe area. Android crops a
    maskable icon to whatever shape the launcher likes, so a rounded square inside it would read as a
    box in a box; iOS does not crop at all but turns transparency black, which is worse.

The master centres its mark itself, but the fit is still measured from a trial render rather than
derived: the rays reach further than the letters do, and how much of the canvas that reads as is a
question about ink, not about coordinates.
