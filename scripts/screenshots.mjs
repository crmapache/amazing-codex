/**
 * The pictures of the Marketplace listing.
 *
 * The panel alone, in a browser: every frame of scripts/listing/frames.mjs played in the harness's shot
 * mode (`?shot=<id>`, see webview/src/harness/harness.tsx) and photographed at 1200x800 CSS pixels with a
 * device pixel ratio of 2 - a 2400x1600 PNG. The listing itself is now pictures of a whole IDE window
 * (scripts/listing/ide-shots.mjs); this camera stays for frames of the panel on its own. What is in a
 * frame lives in webview/src/harness/scenarios/showcase.ts and what is done to it in frames.mjs - the two
 * cameras share both.
 *
 * How to run it:
 *
 *   cd webview && pnpm dev            # the harness on :5190, in a terminal of its own
 *   npm i playwright --prefix /tmp/acx-shots      # once: Playwright is not a dependency of this repo
 *   PLAYWRIGHT=/tmp/acx-shots/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs node scripts/screenshots.mjs
 *
 * The pictures land in build/screenshots (override with OUT=...). A name on the command line shoots
 * only the frames it matches: `node scripts/screenshots.mjs 03 statistics`.
 *
 * Playwright is deliberately not in package.json: it is a hundreds-of-megabytes browser download for a
 * job done a few times a release, and Gradle installs this workspace's dependencies on every build.
