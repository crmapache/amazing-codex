/**
 * The listing's pictures of a whole IDE window: the project tree, the editor and the panel, in a real
 * WebStorm with the plugin in it.
 *
 * The panel in the sandbox loads its interface from the dev server, and the camera walks it to the harness
 * page of each frame (see frames.mjs) - so the feed is the scripted showcase, while everything around it is
 * the IDE itself: the demo project open, the file the conversation is about in the editor, the chip with
 * that file in the panel's input field. The window is captured by its id, never by a region of the screen.
 *
 * How to run it:
 *
 *   node scripts/listing/demo-project.mjs              # the project the IDE shows, with the sandbox closed
 *   cd webview && pnpm dev                             # the interface on :5190, in a terminal of its own
 *   ./gradlew runIde -PopenProject=$HOME/work/nimbus-checkout -PwebviewDevUrl=http://localhost:5190/ \
 *     -PjcefDebugPort=4452
 *   npm i playwright --prefix /tmp/acx-shots          # once: Playwright is not a dependency of this repo
 *   PLAYWRIGHT=/tmp/acx-shots/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs node scripts/listing/ide-shots.mjs
 *
 * Raw window captures land in build/listing/ide (override with OUT=...); compose.mjs then puts the
 * caption band over them. A name on the command line shoots only the frames it matches.
